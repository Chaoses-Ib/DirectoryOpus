# Script Dialogs

Scripts are able to define free-form dialogs in much the same way that “proper” Windows software can, using many of the standard Windows controls.

Above is an example of the type of dialog that scripts can create. Dialogs are defined as “resources” – XML formatted data that defines the dialog and control layout. Any script can have resources attached – either a script in a button, or one in the Script Add-Ins folder.

A full GUI-based dialog editor is provided inside the script and function editors, which makes it very easy to design script dialogs.
