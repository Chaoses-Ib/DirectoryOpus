# Creating Script Dialogs

##### In script add-ins

Dialogs can be created via the *Resources* tab in the [script editor](../script_editor/RAEDME.md).

##### In button functions

When you're in [Customize](/Manual/customize/RAEDME.md) mode and editing a button that's set as a *[Script Function](../script_functions.md)*, a **Resources** tab is visible:

This tab lets you edit the [resources](../resources/RAEDME.md) associated with the script function. You can edit them in free-form XML if you like, but for dialogs you can also use the in-built dialog editor which is a much easier way of designing dialogs.

To add a script dialog, select the **Resources** tab and then click the **Dialogs** drop-down, as shown above. The **New Dialog** command will prompt you for a name for your dialog (this is the name your script will use to access it), and then display the [dialog editor](../script_editor/editors/dialog_editor/RAEDME.md).

You can see in the above image that three dialogs have already been defined - **books**, **interests** and **person**. You can edit existing dialogs simply by selecting them from the **Dialogs** drop-down.
