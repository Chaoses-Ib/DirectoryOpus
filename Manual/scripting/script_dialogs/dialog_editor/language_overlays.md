# Language Overlays

Language overlays allow you to provide translations of your dialog in other languages. A language overlay provides translations of all the text in a dialog and can optionally adjust the size and position of controls or the dialog itself (to accommodate languages which on average have longer or shorter strings than the “base language” of the dialog). When the user invokes your dialog Opus will automatically select the language overlay to match the user’s current language (if one has been provided).

The **Language overlays** command ( ![](/Manual/images/media/image108.png) ) is modal. Turn it on to edit language overlays, and off again to go back to the regular design mode. In language overlay mode, the *Control palette* will change to display a list of configured language overlays.

To add a new overlay, click the **Add New Language** item. A dialog will prompt you to select the language you wish to create an overlay for, and also which language you want to copy the overlay from initially. To edit an existing overlay, simply select it from the list.

While editing a language overlay the properties for selected controls are reduced – only the title can be edited. You can reposition and resize controls and the dialog, but you can’t add or remove any controls.
