# Group Box Properties

The specific properties applicable to the *Group Box* control are:

- **Group Header**: Set to **True** to make this a group header (designed to separate two sections of a dialog) rather than a group box (designed to enclose a group of related controls).
- **No Prefix**: Disables the usual mnemonic (keyboard accelerator) behaviour if the controlâ€™s title contains an ampersand (this lets you have a group title containing an ampersand).
