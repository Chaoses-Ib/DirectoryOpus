# Tab Control Properties

The specific properties applicable to the *Tab Control* are:

- **Fixed Width**: Set to **True** to make all the tabs the same width; if set to **False** they will auto-size to fit their labels.
- **Tabs**: Specifies which dialogs will appear as tabs in this control (and the order in which theyâ€™ll appear). You must create the dialogs (in the same script) before you can add them to a tab.
- **Selection**: Sets the initially selected tab index.
