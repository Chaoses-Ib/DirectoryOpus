# Script Log

The Script Log can display text output and errors from scripts and other functions. To show the Script Log, select it from the **Help \> Logs** menu.

The Script Log displays user output from a number of sources:

- Script add-ins and buttons that use the `DOpus.Output()` function.
- Evaluator clauses that use the `Output()` function.
- Button and menu functions that use the `@output:` modifier.

Any errors in scripts or evaluator clauses are also reported in the Script Log.
