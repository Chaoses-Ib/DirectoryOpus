# Adding Dialog Controls

To add a control to your dialog, simply click it in the control palette, and then click again on the dialog to place it. You can also drag-and-drop directly from the control palette to the workspace.

You can also make copies of existing controls using the clipboard (e.g. <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd>).

Script dialogs support a number of the standard Windows control types (other types may be added in the future):

##### Static Text

![](/Manual/images/media/image110.png)  
Displays a static text string. The control type is used for labels and instructions.

##### Markup Text

Like a static text string, except it supports simple HTML markup, including clickable links.

##### Edit Control

![](/Manual/images/media/image111.png)  
A field that you can enter text into. Supports various sub-types including single line, multiple line, password and number.

##### Button

![](/Manual/images/media/image113.png)  
A push button that you can click to trigger an action.

##### Check Box

![](/Manual/images/media/image115.png)  
A checkbox button; can be on or off (or optionally, a third “indeterminate” state).

##### Radio Button

![](/Manual/images/media/image116.png)  
A radio button; can be on or off. Provides mutual exclusion with other radio buttons in the same logical group.

##### Combo Box

![](/Manual/images/media/image118.png)  
Provides a drop-down list in its default mode. Can also provide an edit field combined with a drop-down list, or an edit field combined with a flat list.

##### List Box

![](/Manual/images/media/image120.png)  
Provides a flat list that the user can select one or more strings from.

##### List View

![](/Manual/images/media/lvimage.png)  
Similar to a List Box, but offers multiple columns and alternate display modes.

##### Tab Control

![](/Manual/images/media/image121.png)  
A control that can host other dialogs. Each sub-dialog appears as a tab.

##### Group Box

![](/Manual/images/media/image123.png)  
Used to draw a box around other controls, or as a header to divide two sections of a dialog.
