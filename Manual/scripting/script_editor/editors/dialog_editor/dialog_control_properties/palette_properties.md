# Palette Properties

The specific properties applicable to the *Palette* control are:

- **Palette Type**: Four types are supported - normal, alpha (supports alpha values), transparent (supports a "transparent" option) and default (supports a "default" option).
- **No Arrow**: Prevents the control showing a dropdown arrow glyph.
- **Can Disable**: The control will display a checkbox which lets the color be turned off.
- **Decimal**: Color values are reported in as decimal ("RRR,GGG,BBB") rather than hex ("#RRGGBB").
