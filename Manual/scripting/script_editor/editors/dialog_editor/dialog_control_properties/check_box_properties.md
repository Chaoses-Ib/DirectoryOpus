# Check Box Properties

The specific properties applicable to the *Check Box* control are:

- **Tri-state**: Set to **True** to give this check box a third state, “indeterminate”. This third state appears to the user as a solid rectangle inside the checkbox ( ![](/Manual/images/media/image126.png) ). If set to **False** the check box will have only two states, *on* and *off*.
- **Check State**: Use this to control the default state of the check box. The state can also be changed programmatically by your script.
