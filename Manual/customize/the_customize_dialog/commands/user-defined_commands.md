# User-defined Commands

User-defined commands are pre-defined commands that you create yourself. Effectively it's like creating a toolbar button with your own function on it, but instead of the button living on a toolbar, it lives in this command list and other buttons or menus can refer to it by name.

See the page on [User-defined commands](../../creating_your_own_buttons/user-defined_commands.md) in the [Creating your own buttons](../../creating_your_own_buttons/RAEDME.md) section of the manual for more details.
