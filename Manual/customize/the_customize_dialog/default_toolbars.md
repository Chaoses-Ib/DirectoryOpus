# Default Toolbars

This page shows the six [default toolbars](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/RAEDME.md). If you're using old toolbars and want to add new functions from the latest version of Opus to them, this is an easy way to do it - simply drag the desired button or menu out from this dialog and drop it on your own toolbars.

The vertical slider on the left of the dialog lets you "go back in time" and see when buttons in the default toolbars were changed or added for the first time.

This example is highlighting all buttons that were added (or significantly modified) in Opus 13.0. Drag the slider down further to go further back in time. The idea is that when upgrading Opus, you can easily work out what's new since your last major version and add them to your toolbars without having to reset them completely.

By default the toolbars are represented here as they appear in the Lister by default. The **Turn on all button labels** option at the bottom to make all button labels visible, to make it easier to identify commands.

The arrows at the right end of each toolbar can be used to scroll it to access buttons that are out of view. The arrows will also be highlighted themselves to indicate if a new button is currently out-of-view.

The search field at the bottom will highlight commands in the default toolbars that match the text you enter.
