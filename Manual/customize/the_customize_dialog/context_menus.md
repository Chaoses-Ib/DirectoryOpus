# Context Menus

The Context Menus page is very similar to the [Toolbars](toolbars.md) page. ItÂ lets you configure various context menus (right-button menus). The number of context menus are fixed so you can't create your own like you can with toolbars, but they can all be edited.

##### File display background menus

These menus are used when you right-click on the background (i.e. not on a file or folder) in a Lister's file display area. The menu that appears depends on the type of folder that's currently being viewed.

##### Other menus

- **Column Header**: Shown when you right-click the column header in a details or power mode file display.
- **Copy Highlighted Cells**: Shown when you right-click cells that you've [highlighted](/Manual/basic_concepts/selecting_files/selecting_cells.md).
- **Folder Tabs**: Shown when you right-click a folder tab.
- **Image Viewer**: Shown when you right-click the background in the standalone image viewer.
- **Tray Icon**: The context menu for the icon that Opus places in the taskbar notification area (a.k.a. "tray icon", "systray", etc).

##### Backups

If any of your context menus were backed up and replaced as part of the upgrade process, the backups will be shown here in their own category. You can edit them to copy commands out into the new menus.

##### Editing a context menu

To edit a menu from this dialog, double-click it, right-click it and choose Edit, or use the Edit toolbar button.

The menu will be displayed in a popup window - kind of like a floating toolbar - and it's this window where you can edit the buttons on the menu.

You can also choose **Edit alongside default**. This opens the current menu as well a read-only copy of the default menu at the same time. You can drag commands from the default menu into your custom menu if you need to access any default commands you've deleted or changed.

##### Options

On the right-hand side of the dialog page are the same **Options** settings that are found on the [Toolbars](toolbars.md) tab. Select a menu from the list to make changes to these settings.
