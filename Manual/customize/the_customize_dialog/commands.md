# Commands

The *Commands* page displays a list of pre-defined commands that you can easily add to toolbars by drag and drop. They mostly come from [the default toolbars](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/README.md).

The commands are divided into a number of categories that loosely groups similar commands. You can use the search field at the bottom of the page to search for a command by name or description.

Click a command in the list on the right to see a full description of it underneath, along with information about where it comes from if applicable.

All these commands are built from the [internal command set](/Manual/reference/command_reference/internal_commands/README.md). Of course these commands are not the only ones available in Opus - they're just a starting point. When you select a command from the list the underlying raw command is shown as well.

Drag a command from the list to add it to a toolbar or menu.
