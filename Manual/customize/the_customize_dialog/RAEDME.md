# The Customize Dialog

The Customize dialog appears when you enter [Customize](/Manual/customize/RAEDME.md) mode. It is divided into a number of tabbed pages.

- **[Commands](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/commands/RAEDME.md)**: Displays a list of commands that you can easily add to toolbars by drag and drop.
- **[Toolbars](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/toolbars.md)**: Displays a list of your toolbars, lets you turn them on or off, and create and edit new ones.
- **[Keys](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/keys.md)**: Displays a list of all configured hotkeys and lets you edit them and create new ones.
- **[Context Menus](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/context_menus.md)**: This is where various context menus can be edited. The context menus for files and folders are not edited through here - instead they are controlled through the [File Types](/Manual/file_types/RAEDME.md) system. The context menus here are for user interface elements like the column header in a details mode file display, the taskbar icon and so on.

At the top of the Customize dialog, the **File** menu contains a number of commands:

- **Import**: The behavior of this command depends on the currently selected page in the Customize dialog.
- **Export**: Same for this; what is actually exported depends on the current page.
- **Save Floating Toolbars**: This command saves the state and position of any floating toolbars that are currently displayed. For example, if you want to set up a floating toolbar to act as a program launcher, you would float it, position it as desired, and then choose this command to make Opus remember this for the future. If you turn on the **Save state of floating Toolbars automatically on exit** option on the [Toolbar Options](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/toolbars/toolbar_options.md) Preferences page, your floating toolbars will be remembered automatically when Opus shuts down.
- **Undo Changes**: This command depends on the current selection in the current page. For example, on the Toolbars page it lets you restore the currently selected toolbar, undoing any changes to it since Customize mode was entered.
- **Undo All Changes**: This command will undo all changes to everything it is possible to undo since Customize mode was entered. Clicking the **Cancel** button on the Customize dialog has the same effect.
