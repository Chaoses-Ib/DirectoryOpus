# Lister-Linked Viewers

TOBEDONE

Quick information to help until we finish writing a page for this:

- A Lister-Linked viewer is like a detached preview pane. When you select a file in the main Opus window, the viewer displays that file, but it can be in a separate window or full-screen on a second monitor.

- To open a Lister-Linked viewer, right-click the Viewer Pane icon at the top-right of the default toolbars, just left of the search field.

- If you're using toolbars from an older version and that doesn't do anything, grab the updated button from Settings \> Customize \> Default Toolbars.

- \<WRAP\>After opening a viewer, you can also link it to the Lister it came from via the "Link to Lister" button on the viewer toolbar.  
  (If using old toolbars, grab the button from Default Toolbars, similar to above.)\</WRAP\>

- \<WRAP\>Linking is one-way by default. For two-way, so changing image in the viewer changes the active file in the Lister as well, turn on:  
  **Settings \> Preferences / Viewer / Standalone Viewer / Link both ways (file display selection tracks Lister-linked viewer)**\</WRAP\>

- \<WRAP\>If you'd like to always have viewers open linked (e.g when double-clicking a photo), see this forum thread:  
  [Make Standalone Viewer automatically link when it opens](https://resource.dopus.com/t/make-standalone-viewer-automatically-link-when-it-opens/46148/3)  
  (We plan to add a Preferences option for this in the future, to make things easier.)\</WRAP\>
