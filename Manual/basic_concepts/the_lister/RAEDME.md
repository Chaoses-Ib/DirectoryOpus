# The Lister

The main file manager window in Opus is called a "Lister".

![](/Manual/images/media/13/lister_simple.png) 

The screenshot above shows a basic Lister with the default Opus configuration. It features three top toolbars, a folder tree on the left, and the file display on the right (with another toolbar above it.) The folder tree highlights the C: drive, whose contents are depicted to its right. Below the file display is the folder tab bar - currently, only one tab is open (the one showing C:) but you can open as many folders as you like each in their own tab, and rapidly switch between them.

Below that lies the status bar, offering a configurable summary of the contents of the folder.

While the Lister might appear similar to Windows File Explorer, Opus intentionally mirrors its design for initial user familiarity. Beneath the interface, Opus provides advanced functionality that users can gradually explore.

This screenshot illustrates a much more complex Lister, and immediately you can see that the resemblance to Explorer is only superficial. The key user interface elements visible in this screenshot are:

- **File displays**: The core element of the Lister, the file display lets you see the contents of the current folder. You can choose how files and folders are arranged (both [sorting and grouping](sorting_and_grouping/RAEDME.md) can be configured), and you can use [filters](searching_and_filtering/RAEDME.md) to hide or show certain files or types of files. Most actions (like copying / deleting files, creating folders, adding to archives, etc) take place within the file displays. Listers can display either one or two file displays simultaneously, and each file display can have one or more [tabs](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/tabs/RAEDME.md), each of which can display the contents of a different folder. Each file display has a configurable toolbar displayed above it that shows the current location and provides basic navigation buttons. There are a number of options in Preferences that affect the appearance and behaviour of file displays (for example, you can have grid lines shown, enable full-row selection mode, etc). See the **[File Displays](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_displays/RAEDME.md)** and **[File Display Modes](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_display_modes/RAEDME.md)** categories in Preferences for more information.
- **Default toolbars**: The Menu, Operations and Favorites toolbars are the [default set of toolbars](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/RAEDME.md) built-in to Opus. These toolbars can be turned on or off, and edited, but they can't be deleted or renamed - and you can easily reset them to their defaults at any time. Also shown above is the default Images toolbar, which is displayed whenever a file display is set to thumbnails mode. Of course you can [create your own toolbars](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/toolbars.md) with any combination of buttons that you like - many people turn off the default toolbars as soon as they install Opus and never look at them again!
- **Search field**: The [search field](/Manual/basic_concepts/searching_and_filtering/windows_search.md) lets you quickly run a search using Windows search, the Opus internal [find tool](searching_and_filtering/find_files/RAEDME.md), or [Everything](/Manual/additional_functionality/everything_integration.md) if you have it installed.
- **Location bar**: The [location bar](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/file_display_border.md) is a toolbar bar that appears at the top of the file displays. While fully configurable like other toolbars its primary purpose is navigation.
- **Folder trees**: The [folder tree](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/folder_tree.md) displays the folder hierarchy that leads to the currently selected folder. You can turn the folder trees on or off, and in a dual display Lister, you can choose to have a separate folder tree for each file display, or a single folder tree that is shared between them. Folder Trees can be both a navigational tool (clicking on a new folder in the tree will display its contents in the file display), and as a target for file operations (e.g. you can drag a file from the file display and drop it on another folder in the tree to copy or move it).
- **Viewer pane**: The [Viewer pane](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/viewer_pane.md) displays the contents of the selected file. Opus supports dozens of different image and movie file formats natively, and also has a viewer plugin system that lets third-party developers write viewers for unsupported file types. Additionally, Opus ships with a viewer plugin that leverages ActiveX technology to display files like Office and PDF documents.
- **Utility panel**: This is a multi-facted panel that provides access to several [utility features](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/utility_panel.md), including **[Find](searching_and_filtering/find_files/RAEDME.md)** (search for files and folders, based on definable criteria), **[Synchronize](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copying_updated_files/synchronize.md)** (synchronize the contents of one drive or folder, including remote FTP sites, with another) and **[Duplicate Files](/Manual/additional_functionality/duplicate_file_finder.md)** (search for any files that are duplicated, or for duplicates of specific files). Additionally, the Utility Panel is used to display several logs including the file operations log, the FTP activity log and script output.
- **Metadata pane**: This pane lets you view and edit the [metadata](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/metadata_pane.md) for the selected file or files. Many different image, music and document file types are supported.
- **Status bar**: Displays statistics on the current folder, including total number of files, files hidden by filters, free space on the drive and more. You can [configure](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/status_bar.md) what information is displayed through Preferences.
- **Filter bar**: Provides quick access to filename filters, letting you [control which files are shown or hidden](searching_and_filtering/filter_bar.md) in the folder.
- **Folder tabs**: Using [Folder Tabs](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/tabs/RAEDME.md) you can open multiple folders at the same time and easily switch between them.
