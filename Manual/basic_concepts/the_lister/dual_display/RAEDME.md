# Dual Display

The term *dual-display mode* refers to the display of two independent file displays in the one Lister. Each file display can show the contents of a different folder (and can have multiple tabs).

Dual-display mode makes it particularly easy to compare the contents of two folders, or copy or move files between two folders, without needing to open multiple windows or change folder a lot. Another common use is to display the same folder in both displays, in two different view modes - for example, details mode in one and thumbnails in the other.

##### Switching into dual-display mode

The easiest way to put a Lister into dual-display mode is with the buttons on the default toolbar:

- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/dual_button_h.png) switches to horizontal layout
- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/dual_button.png) switches to vertical layout

You can also press <kbd>F6</kbd>, which toggles between single-display and dual-display in whichever layout (horizontal or vertical) you last used.

When a Lister first goes into dual-display mode, the currently displayed folder will be duplicated in the new display by default. You can change this to always show a particular folder or tab group with the options on the **[File Displays / Options](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_displays/options/RAEDME.md)** Preferences page.

##### Copying files in dual-display mode

When a Lister is in dual-display mode you can copy or move files from one display to the other using drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste.

Dual-display mode also ties in with the **[source and destination](../source_and_destination.md)** concept - whenever a Lister is in dual-display mode, one display is always designated the source folder and the other is the destination. This means that commands like **Copy Files** will always copy selected items from one display in the Lister to the other.
