# The Default Toolbars

Opus ships with five default toolbars built-in to the program, as well as a number of *example* toolbars installed by the installer.

##### Default toolbars

The default toolbars are a set of five toolbars that are hard-coded into the program. They are created on disk automatically when Opus first runs, and are automatically re-created if they are ever accidentally deleted. The default toolbars cannot be deleted or renamed, although they can be turned off and you are able to edit them freely.

The default toolbars in Directory Opus are designed to expose as much as possible of the functionality of the program without appearing too busy or overly complicated.

You can reset an individual default toolbar at any time, either by right-clicking it and choosing **Factory reset this toolbar** from the context menu, or from the [Toolbars](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/toolbars.md) tab in the *Customize* dialog.

##### Example toolbars

The Opus installer creates several toolbars automatically when you install the program. These can more properly be described as "pre-supplied" toolbars, as they are not hard-coded into the program, and there is nothing special about them other than the fact that the installer creates them. They are provided mainly as examples. You are free to delete these as you wish.

##### Selected toolbars can be different for each Lister

The toolbars a Lister opens with by default is determined by where the Lister came from. If the Lister came from a saved [layout](../layouts/README.md), its toolbars may have been stored with it. If not, a Lister will usually open with the *Default Toolbar Set.* This is a special [toolbar set](toolbar_sets.md) that determines a Lister's initial set of toolbars. Use the **Settings / Toolbars / Set As Default Toolbar Set** command to update your default toolbar set if you want to change which toolbars are used by default.
