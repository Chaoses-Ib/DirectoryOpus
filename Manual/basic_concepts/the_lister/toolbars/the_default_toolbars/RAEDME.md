# The Default Toolbars

There are two types of "default" toolbars in Opus.

- The "real" default toolbars are a set of four toolbars that are hard-coded into the program. They are created on disk automatically when Opus first runs, and are automatically re-created if they are ever accidentally deleted. The default toolbars cannot be deleted or renamed, although they can be turned off and you are able to edit them freely. You can reset your configuration to the default toolbars at any time, by right-clicking on a toolbar and choosing **Factory Reset Toolbars** from the context menu's **Toolbars** sub-menu.
- The Opus installer creates several toolbars automatically when you install the program. These can more properly be described as "pre-supplied" toolbars, as they are not hard-coded into the program, and there is nothing special about them other than the fact that the installer creates them. They are provided mainly as examples. You are free to delete these as you wish.

Which toolbars a Lister opens with by default is determined by where the Lister came from. If the Lister came from a saved [layout](../layouts/RAEDME.md), its toolbars may have been stored with it. If not, a Lister will usually open with the *Default Toolbar Set.* This is a special [toolbar set](toolbar_sets.md) that determines a Lister's initial set of toolbars. Use the **Settings / Toolbars / Set As Default Toolbar Set** command to update your default toolbar set if you want to change which toolbars are used by default.

The default toolbars in Directory Opus are designed to expose as much as possible of the functionality of the program without appearing too busy or overly complicated. The four toolbars are as follows:

The **[Menu\*\* toolbar](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/menu_toolbar.md)**:

![](/Manual/images/media/menu_toolbar.png) 

This toolbar contains the "traditional" drop-down menus, as well as controls for modifying the appearance of the Lister.

The **[Operations\*\* toolbar](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/operations_toolbar.md)**:

![](/Manual/images/media/operations_toolbar.png) 

This toolbar contains commands relating to file and folder operations.

The **[File Display](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/file_display_toolbar.md)** toolbar appears at the top of each file display (unless disabled in Preferences):

![](/Manual/images/media/file_display_toolbar.png)

This toolbar mainly contains commands related to navigation.

The **[Images](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/toolbars/the_default_toolbars/images_toolbar.md)** toolbar appears whenever a file display is set to [Thumbnails mode](../view_modes.md):

![](/Manual/images/media/images_toolbar.png)

This toolbar contains basic image manipulation functions.
