# File Display Toolbar

This toolbar is displayed at the top of each file display (assuming the option to use a toolbar for the [File Display border](../../navigation/file_display_border.md) is turned on in [Preferences](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_displays/file_display_border.md)).

The elements on this toolbar are:

- ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_back.png) **Back**: Navigates back to the previously displayed folder. Right-click (or click and hold with the left button) the button to display a list of all prior folders.  
  \* ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_forward.png) **Forward**: Navigates forward in the history (once you have moved back, you can go forward again). Right-click (or click and hold with the left button) the button to display a list of any folders forward of the current position.  
  \* ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_up.png) **Up**: Navigates up to the parent of the current folder. See the **[Up, Forwards, Back](../../navigation/up_forwards_back.md)** page for more information on these three concepts.

If you right-click (or click and hold with the left button) the button a drop-down menu is displayed that contains a number of links to special locations, for quick navigation. It also contains a menu of your [recent](../../navigation/recent_and_history_lists.md) locations. For users upgrading from Opus 9, this drop-down is the equivalent of the old "Go" menu (and you can still press **Alt+G** to open it).

- ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_favorites.png)**Favorites**: Displays a drop-down list of your [favorite folders](../../navigation/favorites.md), as well as your **Quick Access** items (on newer versions of Windows) and your [SmartFavorites](../../navigation/smartfavorites.md) (if enabled).  
  \* ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_breadcrumbs.png) **Location**: A ["breadcrumbs" location field](../../navigation/breadcrumbs_location_field.md) that displays your current location.  
  \* ![](/Manual/images/media/location_toolbar_-_compatibility.png) **Compatibility Files**: In certain folders this button will appear. Clicking it lets you easily move to and from the [compatibility folder](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/compatibility_files.md) for the current location.

The remaining elements are not actually part of the toolbar - they are part of the underlying [File Display border](../../navigation/file_display_border.md).
