# Dynamic Toolbars

Besides being able to turn toolbars on and off manually, you can configure Opus to show toolbars (or [toolbar sets](toolbar_sets.md)) automatically based on certain conditions.

##### In certain view modes

Opus can automatically show a toolbar when the [display mode](../view_modes.md) changes. For example, the [Images](the_default_toolbars/images_toolbar.md) toolbar is configured by default to show whenever a file display is set to *Thumbnails* mode.

View mode toolbars are configured from the **[Toolbars / View Mode Toolbars](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/toolbars/view_mode_toolbars.md)** Preferences page.

##### In certain folders

You can configure Opus to automatically show a toolbar whenever you navigate to a certain folder, or to a folder containing predominantly a certain type of file.

Folder-specific toolbars are configured using the [Folder Formats](../../folder_options/folder_formats.md) system.
