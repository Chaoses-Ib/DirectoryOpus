## Themes

A theme is a subset of your Opus configuration containing just the color, font, and image settings. You can switch between different themes or share them with others.

To access the themes system, select the [Colors and Fonts / Themes](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/colors_and_fonts/themes.md) page in Preferences.

The Themes page displays a list of all themes you have installed. You download more themes from the [Opus Resource Centre](http://www.gpsoft.com.au/DScripts/redirect.asp?page=themes).
