You must provide a number of parameters when saving a theme:

- **Theme Name**: The name of the new theme. This is the name that will be displayed in the themes list in the Lister Themes dialog.
- **Description**: This lets you provide a description of your new theme.
- **Author Info**: You can use this to provide some information about yourself (your name, or a copyright string if desired)
- **URL**: An optional URL that links to information about the theme (or your own website, it's up to you)
- **Preview Image**: This lets you embed a preview image in the theme file. This preview is displayed as a thumbnail in the themes list in the Lister Themes dialog, and as a larger preview when your theme is selected from the list. It's good to provide a preview so that people you share your theme with have some idea of what they're going to get when they apply it.\<WRAP\>

You can provide a preview image in three ways:

      * By browsing for an image file
      * By pasting an image from the clipboard
      * By taking a snapshot of an open Lister (drag the crosshair icon out)

\</WRAP\>

- **Content**: These options let you choose which aspects of your configuration are to be included in the theme. For example, you may only want your theme to specify colors and images. The options you check will be included in the theme and when the theme is applied, only those aspects of the configuration will be changed.

Once you've defined your theme click the **OK** button to save it.
