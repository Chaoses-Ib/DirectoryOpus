# Navigation

There are many ways you can navigate (that is, move from one folder to another) in a Lister, including:

- You can double-click a folder in the current location to enter it. You can also enter a folder by right-clicking on it and choosing **Open** from the context menu, or from the keyboard by using the cursor keys to select it and then pressing the **Enter** key.
- **[The Up, Forward and Back buttons](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/up_forwards_back.md)**: The default **File Display** toolbar contains buttons that can move you up in the folder hierarchy, back to the previous folder or forward to the next folder.
- **[The Folder Tree](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/folder_tree.md)**: You can change folder by simply clicking on a new folder in the tree (you can also navigate via the tree using the keyboard cursor keys).
- **[Location Bar](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/file_display_border.md)**: If the **File Display** toolbar has been disabled, a smaller location bar is displayed in dual-display mode which shows the current path and provides some default navigation buttons.
- **[The Breadcrumbs location field](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/breadcrumbs_location_field.md)**: The default **File Display** toolbar contains a field known as the 'breadcrumbs location field'. This displays your current location as "breadcrumbs" that indicate the path from the desktop to your current folder. Each "crumb" in the path is active and can be clicked or expanded. You can also type into this bar in order to navigate to a folder using the keyboard.
- **[The Find-as-you-type Field](find-as-you-type_field.md)**: By default the Find-as-you-type field (FAYT) lets you navigate by simply typing a path into the file display (e.g. click in the file display, and start typing a path).
- **[Favorites](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/favorites.md)**: You can add folders to a list of your favorite locations - navigating to these folders is simply a matter of selecting them from the drop-down menu. Access the favorites from the drop-down on the default **File Display **toolbar or from the tree.
- **[SmartFavorites](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/smartfavorites.md)**: If enabled, the **SmartFavorites** system attempts to learn your most commonly used locations automatically. A list of these locations is then displayed in the drop-down Favorites menu.
- **[Recent and History Lists](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/recent_and_history_lists.md)**: Opus maintains two lists of your recently used locations, that you can use to instantly go back to a folder you were recently in. One (the **Recent** list) is global to the program, and the other (the **History** list) is local to a file display.
- **[Aliases](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/aliases.md)**: You can define aliases that reference a folder by a simple name - you can then navigate to an aliased folder by typing its name into the location field.
