# Favorites

The Favorites system in Opus is very similar to that of a web browser. Important folders that you want to have quick access to can be added to the favorites list, and this list can be displayed in a toolbar (the [Favorites Bar](../toolbars/the_default_toolbars/favorites_bar.md)), a drop-down menu and in the [folder tree](folder_tree.md).

### Favorites Bar

The favorites bar toolbar is turned on by default, and works like the bookmarks bar in a web browser does. You can use drag-and-drop to add folders to the bar and reposition them. To go to a favorite folder from the bar, simply click it. You can rename them or remove them via the right-click context menu.

Just like a web browser's bookmarks bar, the favorites bar shows a particular branch of your complete favorites list. The **Other Favorites** dropdown menu on the right shows you your full favorites list (minus the favorites bar folder, by default), and has links to edit it in Preferences.

The **Quick Access** dropdown has hard-coded links for several useful folders - your user profile directories, your drives, and special system folders like This PC and the Desktop.

### Accessing without the Favorites Bar

If your turn off the Favorites Bar toolbar, a dropdown menu button will appear on the [Location Bar](file_display_border.md) toolbar by default.

This provides access to your favorites list without needing to have the favorites bar toolbar open. Note that unlike the **Other Favorites** dropdown, the list it shows includes the favorites bar folder.

### Adding a favorite to the list

If you use the **Add to Favorites** command from either of the dropdown menus, the *Add to Favorites* dialog appears. This lets you add the current folder to your favorites list, and lets you provide a name for it and choose which branch to put it in.

### Dragging to favorites

In both the favorites bar and the drop-down menus, favorite folders shown in this menu can also be used to copy or move files to by dragging a file and dropping it directly onto them. You can also right-click favorites to display the context menu for that folder.

### Showing favorites in the tree

Favorite folders can be displayed in the [Folder Tree](folder_tree.md) by turning on the **Favorites** item on the **[Folder Tree / Contents](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/folder_tree/contents.md)** Preferences page.

### Editing the favorites list via Preferences

You can add, rename, delete and rearrange your favorite folders at any time using the **[Favorites List](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/favorites_list.md)** page in Preferences.
