# Favorites

The Favorites system in Opus is very similar to that of a web browser. Important folders that you want to have quick access to can be added to the favorites list, and this list is then displayed in a drop-down menu at the top of each file display.

To add the current location to the favorites list, click the **Favorites** button (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_001.png)) on the file display toolbar, and select the **Add To Favorites** command from the drop-down menu, or press **Ctrl+D**. This will display the **Add to Favorites** dialog:

The **Folder** field displays the current folder - this is picked up from the current source file display automatically and can't be edited. The **Name** field lets you assign a name to the favorite entry - by default, this is the full path of the folder but you can edit this to be just the name of the folder (the text preceding the folder's name is automatically selected for easy deletion) or indeed to any name at all.

The **Create in** field lets you create "sub-folders" (or branches) within your favorites list. Click the **New Branch** button to create a new folder - it will be created as a child of the currently selected branch. The new favorite will be stored in the selected branch. You can rearrange your favorites later using the **[Favorites](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/favorites_and_recent/favorites.md)** page in Preferences.

To navigate to a favorite folder, simply select it from the drop-down favorites menu as shown above. The favorite folders shown in this menu can also be used to copy or move files to by dragging a file and dropping it onto the menu item. You can also right-click on the folders in the favorites menu to display the context menu for that folder. Favorite folders can also be displayed in the [Folder Tree](folder_tree.md) - turn on the **Favorites** item on the **[Folder Tree / Contents](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/folder_tree/folder_tree_contents.md)** Preferences page.

You can add, rename, delete and rearrange your favorite folders at any time using the **[Favorites](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/favorites_and_recent/favorites.md)** page in Preferences.
