# Recent and History Lists

Opus maintains two separate lists of recently visited folders.

### Recent list

The recent list is a global list of your most recently visited folders. It is displayed in the **Recent Locations** sub-menu in the drop-down menu shown when you right-click the the **Back** button on the [Location Bar toolbar](file_display_border.md).

It is also displayed in the drop-down list attached to the [breadcrumbs path field](breadcrumbs_location_field.md).

It can also be shown in the [folder tree](folder_tree.md) - turn on the **Recent List** item on the [Folder Tree / Contents](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/folder_tree/contents.md) Preferences page.

You can configure the recent list from the **[Recent List](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/recent_list.md)** page in Preferences.

### History list

The history list is also a list of the most recently visited folders, but it is maintained on a per-file display (or per-tab) basis. The history list forms the basis of the **[back and forward](up_forwards_back.md)** navigation actions - when you click the back button, you are moving back through the history list.

Right-click or click-and-hold the **Back** and **Forward** buttons on the Location Bar toolbar to access these lists as drop-down menus.

You can configure the size of the history list (the maximum number of folders remembered) from the [Recent List](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/recent_list.md) page in Preferences.
