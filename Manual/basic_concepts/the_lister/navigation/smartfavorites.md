# SmartFavorites

The SmartFavorites system in Opus is like an "automatic favorites list". It attempts to learn which folders you do most of your work in, and display them in a list as if you had manually added them as favorites. Folders that Opus notices you use a lot are displayed in the drop-down Favorites menu, in a separate section from your manually added favorites folder. See the page on the [Favorites](favorites.md) list for more information about using this drop-down menu.

The SmartFavorites list can also be displayed in the [Folder Tree](folder_tree.md) - turn on the **SmartFavorites **item on the **[Folder Tree / Contents](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/folder_tree/contents.md)** Preferences page.

You can enable or disable, as well as configure the behaviour of, the SmartFavorites system from the **[Frequently Used Paths / SmartFavorites](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/smartfavorites.md)** page in Preferences.
