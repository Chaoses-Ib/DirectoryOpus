# Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the each file display is primarily used to display basic statistics about the current folder.

This is an example of the default status bar. The information presented (from left to right) is:

- Number selected / Total number of folders
- Number selected / Total number of files
- Number of hidden items (if any items are currently [hidden by filters](../searching_and_filtering/RAEDME.md))
- Total size of all selected items / Total size of all items (this includes the size of any selected folders only if their [sizes have been calculated](calculating_folder_sizes.md))
- [Source / destination](../source_and_destination.md) indicator for the current Lister (or file display)
- [Format lock](../folder_options/locking_the_format.md) indicator (![](/Manual/images/media/tab_unlocked.png))
- Space free on current drive
- Percentage of used space on current drive

You can use the **[Display / Status Bar](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/display/status_bar.md)** page in Preferences to configure the information displayed in the status bar. Using the various available status bar codes it is possible to configure some quite complicated status bar displays:

The options on that Preferences page also let you change the status bar to appear at the bottom of the Lister instead of the file display (so, for example, you can have one single file display at the bottom of the window that applies only to the active file display instead of each display having its own).

# Status Bar

Some status bar elements will show you more information when you hover over them:

- Hidden item indicators show the names of the first few hidden files and folders, so you can quickly see if anything of interest is hidden.

- The format lock indicator shows you where the current folder format comes from, to help you determine how to affect changes to the format.
