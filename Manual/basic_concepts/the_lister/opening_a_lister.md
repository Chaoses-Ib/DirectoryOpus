# Opening a Lister

There are many different ways to open a Lister (or Listers), including:

- When you start Opus from the desktop icon, or the icon on the Windows 7 taskbar, a Lister will open
- If [Explorer Replacement](../explorer_replacement.md) mode is enabled, double-clicking a folder on the desktop, or pressing the **Windows+E** hotkey (even when Opus isn't running)
- If [enabled in Preferences](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/launching_opus/launching_opus_from_the_desktop.md), you can double-click on an empty spot on the desktop (even when Opus isn't running)
- If [enabled in Preferences](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/launching_opus/launching_opus_from_the_taskbar_icon.md), you can double-click on the system tray icon that Opus adds when it's running
- You can set Opus to [run on startup](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/launching_opus/launching_opus_on_startup.md) and automatically show a Lister when it does
- You can load a saved [Lister Layout](layouts/RAEDME.md) from the desktop context menu or the **Settings** menu in an existing Lister
- You can use one of the [internal commands](/Manual/reference/command_reference/internal_commands/RAEDME.md) (like **Go NEW**) to open a Lister from a button or a hotkey (**Windows+Shift+E** is assigned by default)

How you open your Listers really depends on you, and on how you want to work with Opus. You can configure Opus to always open a Lister when it starts up, keeping one open all the time - or to only open one when you need it. You can work with as many or as few Listers open at once as you like.
