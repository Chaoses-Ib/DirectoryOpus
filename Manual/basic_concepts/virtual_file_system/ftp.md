# FTP

You can access remote FTP sites as if they were local folders. Almost all Opus commands will function as they would with normal folders - copying, deleting, creating folders, etc, is all handled just like on a local disk. You can even use the viewer pane to view files on the FTP site without downloading them first.

See the [FTP](/Manual/ftp/RAEDME.md) section of this help file for full information on using the FTP system in Opus.
