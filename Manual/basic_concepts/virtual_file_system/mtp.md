#### MTP

Using Opus you can access the contents of MTP (*Media Transfer Protocol*) compatible devices like cameras, tablets and phones. Almost all Opus commands will function as they would with normal folders - copying, deleting, creating folders, etc, is all handled just like on a real disk drive. The viewer pane and thumbnails mode can be used as normal.

MTP devices are referenced internally using a URL-style path format, with the **mtp://** prefix. For example, the path of your Nexus 7 tablet would be **mtp://Nexus 7/**. You can type this sort of path into the location field, or use it in buttons and hotkeys with the internal command set. If you go to the *root* of the MTP namespace (**mtp://**) by typing the path into the location field, the file display will show you all currently-connected MTP devices. You will also see these devices listed underneath *Computer* (or *My Computer* in XP) in the *Portable Devices* category.
