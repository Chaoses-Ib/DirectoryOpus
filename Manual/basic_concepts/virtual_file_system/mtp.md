# MTP

Using Opus you can access the contents of MTP (*Media Transfer Protocol*) compatible devices like cameras, tablets and phones. Almost all Opus commands will function as they would with normal folders - copying, deleting, creating folders, etc, is all handled just like on a real disk drive. The viewer pane and thumbnails mode can be used as normal.

##### MTP device paths

MTP devices are referenced internally using a URL-style path format, with the \<ib:inline-code\>`mtp://`\</ib:inline-code\> prefix.

For example, the path of your Pixel 8 phone would be \<ib:inline-code\>`mtp://Pixel 8/`\</ib:inline-code\>. You can type this sort of path into the location field, or use it in buttons and hotkeys with the internal command set.

##### MTP root folder

If you go to the *root* MTP folder (\<ib:inline-code\>`mtp://`\</ib:inline-code\>) by typing the path into the location field, the file display will show you all currently-connected MTP devices. You will also see these devices listed underneath *This PC* in the *Portable Devices* category.
