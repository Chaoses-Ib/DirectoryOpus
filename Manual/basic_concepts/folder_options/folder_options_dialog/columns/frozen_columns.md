# Frozen Columns

In *details* and *power* modes you can "freeze" one or more columns, to lock them in place and stop them moving when you scroll the list horizontally.

As you scroll the list to the right, non-frozen columns will disappear underneath the frozen ones.

### How to freeze columns

Columns are always frozen starting with the left-most one. To freeze columns up to a certain point, hold <kbd>Ctrl+Alt</kbd> and left-click the column header. The column you clicked and those to the left of it will be frozen.

You can also right-click the column header and choose the **Freeze Columns To Here** command.

From the [Folder Format dialog](../.md), click in the **Freeze** column on the [Columns]() tab.

### How to unfreeze columns

The "freeze" commands work as a toggle, so to unfreeze columns simply repeat the same steps you used to freeze them.
