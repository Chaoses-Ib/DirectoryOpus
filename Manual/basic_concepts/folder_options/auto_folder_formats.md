# Auto-Remembered Formats

As well as being able to manually save [folder formats](folder_formats.md) for specific folders, Opus can automatically remember changes to the folder format for your most recently used folders.

Automatically remembered formats can be configured from the [Folders / Automatic Formats](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/folders/folder_formats/automatic_formats.md) page in Preferences.

You can choose how many folders Opus will automatically remember the format for.
