# Show Everything

*Show Everything* is a convenient way to quickly see all files in the folder without actually clearing any filters that may be in place. It’s local to the folder tab it is used in.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't confuse *Show Everything* mode with the search tool [Everything by voidtools](https://voidtools.com), which Opus also supports.

##### Activating Show Everything mode

You can activate *Show Everything* mode by clicking the count of hidden items on the status bar.

You can also turn it on using the **Show Everything** in the **Folder** dropdown menu. The [filter bar](filter_bar.md) has a **Show Everything** checkbox which also lets you toggle the mode on and off.

##### Turning Show Everything off again

The default status bar displays **Everything** if *Show Everything* mode is active.

Click the **Everything** label to turn it off (or use the other methods mentioned above).

##### Show Everything and Flat View

*Show Everything* disables all types of filtering within the current folder tab, with one exception: It does not affect folders hidden while in **[Flat View](../flat_view.md)** ***Mixed (No Folders)*** mode.
