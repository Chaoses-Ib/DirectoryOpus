# Single-click mode

Single-click is an optional setting that changes the way files are selected with the mouse. It makes files behave kind of like links on a web page - files are opened with a single-click instead of a double-click, and you can select a file simply by hovering over it with the mouse. Some users prefer this way of working as it reduces the number of mouse clicks (especially double-clicks) that you need to do.

Single-click can be enabled with the **Single click to open an item** option on the **[File Displays / Mouse](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_displays/mouse/README.md)** Preferences page. This option has no effect in Power mode, but in all other [view modes](../../the_lister/view_modes.md), the behaviour of the mouse is modified as follows:

- If you move the mouse over an item and remain there for more than half a second or so, the item will be automatically selected, and all other items are deselected.
- You can select multiple items by hovering with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key held down. You can also range select using the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key. Effectively this is the same behaviour as normal, except you don't actually click to perform the selection - simply hovering over a file is enough.
- If you click on an item with the left button the item will be opened (equivalent to double-clicking on it normally).
