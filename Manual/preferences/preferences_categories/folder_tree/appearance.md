# Appearance

The options on this page affect the appearance of the folder tree.

- **Tree style**: Choose from three tree styles:
  - **Lines**: The traditional style with `+` / `-` buttons next to each folder and dotted lines joining the tree structure.
  - **No Lines**: The same buttons as **Lines** but without the dotted lines.
  - **Visual Style**: The modern style, using the system visual theme, with expansion arrows that fade in and out.
- **Show drive labels as**: This lets you choose how disk drive labels and letters are shown under the *This PC* folder. You can choose labels before letters, letters only, or letters before labels.
- **Custom indent size**: Specify the number of pixels that each level of the tree is indented by.
- **Extra item height**: Add extra height to tree items.
- **Full-row selection**: Lets you click anywhere on the row to select an item. With this option off you need to click on an item's label to select it.Â 
- **Highlight path to selected folder**: The tree will display a "highlight" line that marks the path from the root of the tree to the currently selected folder.
  - **Highlight path to all currently open tabs**: The path to all currently open tabs will be shown instead of just to the active tab. The paths to non-active tabs are faded so as not to obscure the current tab's path.
  - **Only highlight paths when tree is active**: The path highlight will only be shown when the mouse is over the tree or the tree has input focus.
  - **Use color from tab**: If a tab has a non-standard color (if, for example, it's linked to another tab), the highlight path to that tab will be drawn in the tab's color. Otherwise the highlight path is drawn using the color configured on the [Directory Opus Colors](../colors_and_fonts/directory_opus_colors.md) page (*Other Colors - Folder tree: Path to selection*).

- **Separate items at the root level**: Root-level items in the tree (e.g. *Desktop*, *FTP*, *Favorites*, etc) will be separated by blank space, for a less-cluttered visual effect.
  - **Custom spacing**: Specify the number of pixels between root items.
- **Show Folder Tree header**: Displays a title bar at the top of the tree, containing a number of useful buttons.
  - **Show lock button**: The "lock" button will be shown, which lets you lock the tree to prevent it changing selection.
- **Use configured file display colors for tree items**: Folders in the tree will be displayed with the same colors they would be shown as in the file display. If this option is turned off all folders will be shown in the same color.
  - **Including network drives**: Shows network folders using the same colors as well. Depending on any labels you have configured, turning this on can reduce performance.
