# Pins

These options control pins in the folder tree. A pinned folder is permanently expanded.

- **Expansion pins on folder tree branches**: Pins will be shown on items in the tree.
  - **Show pins only on mouse-over**: Pins will be hidden normally, and appear when you move the mouse over the tree.
  - **Require <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down to change pin state**: Makes it harder to click a pin accidentally - you have to <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click them to pin or unpin a branch.
  - **Right-align pins**: Pins will be right-aligned to the window edge rather than attached to the end of the label.
