# This PC

These options apply when Opus implements its own display for the *This PC* folder. See [Virtual Folders](../virtual_folders/README.md) for more information.

- **Use the Opus implementation for the This PC folder**: Lets you enable or disable native display for the virtual *This PC* folder. When native display is on, you can configure the appearance of the folder below.

You can configure the file display format for *This PC* when the native display is enabled using the [Folder Formats](../folder_formats/README.md) page, using the item in the **System folders**Â category.

##### This PC configuration

- **Group drives by storage type**: When turned on local disk drives in the *This PC* folder will have separate groups for HDD, SSD and Other (unknown) - when off, all drives will be listed as "Local drives".
- **Include *Files Stored on This Computer***: This option adds a group to the *This PC* folder which contains links to the document folders on this machine (your own personal folder, and the shared documents folder).
- **Include *Media Servers***: Includes DLNA media servers found on your network.
- **Show empty disk drives**: If this option is turned off, removable disk drives will be hidden from the list of drives if they are empty.
- **Sort drives by name instead of letter**: By default drives are sorted by drive letter (C:, E:, L:, etc). If you turn this on, they will be sorted by their label.
- **Low free space warning**: The bar graph that Opus shows for each drive to indicate how full it is changes color when free space drops below this level (default is 10%). The actual colors used can be configured on the [Directory Opus Colors](../../colors_and_fonts/directory_opus_colors.md) page.
- **Show drive labels as**: Lets you choose how drive labels are displayed.
