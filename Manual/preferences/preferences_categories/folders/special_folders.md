# Special Folders

### Desktop folders

This list shows any special folders that third-party software has added to the desktop. Often (but not always) these are used for cloud storage (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox). Folders that Opus identifies as cloud storage will:

- appear in the separate **Cloud Storage** branch of the folder tree if it's enabled
- trigger the *Cloud Storage* folder format if enabled (to, e.g. add the *Status* column to show sync status).

Opus will try to identify special desktop folders as cloud storage automatically, but if it gets it wrong you can click in the **Cloud Storage** column to mark a folder as cloud storage manually. Folders that are identified automatically will show a ![](/Manual/images/media/13/cloud_grey.png) dark cloud, and folders you've marked yourself will show a ![](/Manual/images/media/13/cloud_white.png) bright cloud.

The **Show** column lets you control where the folder is shown; choose from:

- **Folder Tree**: Appears only in the folder tree (under the **Cloud Storage** folder if it's enabled, and the folder is marked as cloud storage).
- **File Display**: Appears only in the file display.
- **Both**: Appears in both the folder tree and the file display.
- **Hide**: The folder won't be shown at all.

### Other cloud folders

Some cloud software doesn't add a folder to the desktop - for example, Google Drive often adds its own drive letter to the system instead. If you use cloud software that isn't shown in the **Desktop folders** list, you can add its location here to have Opus trigger the *Cloud Storage* folder format automatically for that folder as well.

Note that folders you add here won't currently appear in the **Cloud Storage** branch of the tree - that only works for desktop folders. This limitation may be removed in the future.
