# Folder Display

This page contains options that affect how Opus displays the contents of folders.

- **Add 'Group' column automatically when file display is grouped**: Automatically adds the **Group** column when the file display is [grouped](/Manual/basic_concepts/sorting_and_grouping/RAEDME.md). The column prevents the group headers from appearing between groups, using horizontal space instead of vertical space to indicate where each group starts and ends. If the option is off, you can still add the column explicitly, allowing you to use both styles of grouping in different situations.
- **Display Compatibility Files where possible**: When this option is on Opus will automatically merge the contents of a folder's [compatibility folder](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/compatibility_files.md) when it has one. For example, the compatibility folder for *C:\Program Files* is *C:\Users\\Your Name\>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files*. With this option on, the display of *C:\Program Files* would automatically include the contents of the compatibility folder as well, with items from that folder displayed in a different color. This option doesn't apply to Windows XP.
- **Display localized folder names**: Vista introduced the concept of localized folder names. In Windows XP, the *C:\Program Files* directory (for example) is physically renamed in other languages - e.g. on French systems the folder is *C:\Programmes*. In Vista and above, the folder is always called *C:\Program Files*, but its name is translated when it's displayed in the user interface. With this option on Opus will display the localized name for such folders instead of the real name in the filesystem.
- **Hide the '.lnk' extension for shortcuts**: Shortcut files have the extension **.lnk** - if you turn this option on, the **.lnk** extension will be hidden in file lists.
- **Modify display of all-uppercase filenames**: This lets you modify the display of filenames that are all upper-case, for example legacy files copied from non-long filename filesystems like FAT-formatted drives. The filenames themselves are not altered, just how Opus displays them in the file list.

- **Show shortcut arrows and other icon overlays**: If this option is off, Opus will not display icon overlays such as arrows in the corners of shortcut icons, shared folder indicators, or status indicators from source-control and folder-syncing shell extensions (e.g. TortoiseSVN and DropBox).
- **Show day names in date columns**: If this option is on and a file's timestamp is within the past week, the day of the week (or *Today* or *Yesterday*) will be displayed instead of the actual date.
- **Show relative graphs behind modified date columns**: Displays bar graphs behind the date columns indicating a file's timestamp relative to the oldest file in the folder. These are the same graph shown when the separate *Modify (relative)* and *Create (relative)* columns are turned on.
- **Show relative graphs behind size columns**: Displays a bar graph behind the *Size* column indicating a file's size relative to the largest file in the folder. This is the same graph shown when the separate *Relative Size* column is turned on.
- **Show seconds in time columns**: Opus will show seconds (*hh:mm:ss*) in time columns with this option on - otherwise, it only displays the time using hours and minutes. If seconds are displayed you can also turn on the **Show milliseconds** option to display timestamps with millisecond resolution (to the limit of the underlying file system).
- **Show generic icons**: Most file types use the same icon for all files of that type - for example, all .txt files generally have the same icon. However some file types (most notably **.exe** files) can have a different icon for individual files. Loading this icon can slightly slow down the display time of folders, particularly on network drives, so you can use this option to control whether Opus displays generic icons rather than per-file icons for these types of files.
- **Show cloud storage status icons in the Status column**: In Windows 10, when inside a OneDrive or Dropbox folder, this will cause an icon representing the file's synchronization state to be shown in the *Status* column automatically. Similar status icons will also appear next to files in display modes like List and Thumbnails.
- **Show TortoiseSVN status icons in the Status column**: For developers using the free TortoiseSVN source code control utility, Opus can optionally display a file’s SVN status as an icon in the *Status* column. Other than the status icon appearing larger and more distinctive than the usual icon overlay that Tortoise uses, this can help with the problem of limited icon overlays. Windows only allows a maximum of 15 icon overlays in the system, and Tortoise normally uses 8 or more of these for itself, crowding out other shell extensions. Using this option in Opus gets around the limit as the status is taken directly from Tortoise rather than via the icon overlay. You can also select the icon set to use, and optionally disable the icon overlay handler completely (so that the *Status* column is the only place the TortoiseSVN status icons will appear). Note that this feature requires TortoiseSVN version 1.9.3 or greater.
