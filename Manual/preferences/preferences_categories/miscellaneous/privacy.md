# Privacy

This page lets you configure various privacy-related settings.

Opus normally records file names and paths for various actions you perform, mainly to provide you with historical ("most recently used" - MRU) lists in drop-down menus and suggestion popups.

The various functions listed here all keep a log of recently used names and paths. If you want to stop a particular function from saving history data, turn its checkbox off. You can also clear the data for individual functions by clicking the **Clear history** link that appears when you move the mouse over the list.

The buttons at the bottom let you disable and clear all history items at once.
