# Windows Integration

The options on this page affect how Opus integrates with certain aspects of Windows or Explorer.

- **Add File Collections icon to the Desktop**: Opus will place an icon on your desktop that represents the main [File Collections](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/file_collections/README.md) folder; double-clicking it will open a Lister showing your File Collections.
- **Add File Collections list to the Send To menu**: Opus will add links for your [File Collections](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/file_collections/README.md) to the *Send To* menu (the menu that is displayedÂ when you right-click a file and select *Send to* from its context menu).
- **Add layout and other items to Desktop context menu**: Opus will add several commands to your desktop context menu (the menu that is displayed if you right-click on an empty area of the desktop), including a list of all your configured [Lister Layouts](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/layouts/README.md). This can provide a very quick way of opening a new Lister or a saved layout if you don't currently have any Listers open. You can configure the order your layouts are displayed in, break up the list with separators, and optionally hide some from the display using the [Lister Layouts](../layouts_and_styles/layouts.md) page.
  - **Display layouts in a sub-menu**: If the above option is on then this causes the list of layouts to be displayed in a sub-menu rather than on the desktop context menu itself.
- **Add 'Open in Directory Opus' item to folder context menus**: Opus will add an *Open in Directory Opus* command to the context menu for folders, letting you open them in an Opus Lister via the context menu. This option is only useful when [Explorer Replacement](../launching_opus/explorer_replacement.md) mode is turned off - when Explorer Replacement is on, this command is added anyway and can't be disabled.
- **![](/anchor/ftp/)Make Directory Opus the default handler for FTP sites**: Turning on this option will make Opus the default handler for FTP sites; when you click on an FTP link in a web browser, or a shortcut to an FTP site, it should open in an Opus Lister automatically.
