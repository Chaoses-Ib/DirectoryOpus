# Sounds

The Sounds page lets you assign sound files to be played whenever certain events occur in Opus. Sound events can be enabled or disabled globally with the **Enable Sound Events** checkbox at the top of the page. When enabled globally, individual sound events can also be enabled or disabled with their own checkboxes.

To assign a sound to an event, select the event in question and then use the **Browse** button at the bottom of the page to choose the **.wav** file you want to use. You can preview the sound using the play / stop controls on the right.

The events you can assign sounds to are:

- **Close a Lister**: Played whenever a Lister is closed (except on shutdown).
- **Close Folder Tab**: Played whenever a folder tab is closed.
- **Dock a Floating Toolbar to the screen edge**: If you drag a [floating toolbar](/Manual/additional_functionality/floating_toolbars/README.md) to the edge of the screen to dock it, this sound will play.
- **Dock a Lister with another one**: When Lister docking is enabled in the [Location Bar / Toolbars](../location_bar/toolbars.md) Preferences page, this sound will play whenever you dock two Listers together.
- **Find-As-You-Type No Match**: When typing into the [FAYT](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/find-as-you-type_field.md) field in find mode, this sound plays if the string you type can't be matched to a file.
- **FTP copy failure**: Played if a copy to or from an FTP site fails.
- **FTP copy success**: Played when a copy to or from an FTP site succeeds.
- **FTP error**: Played if an FTP error occurs.
