# External Tools

This page lets you configure certain external tools which are used by various functions. If you don't configure these the default tools will be used.

- **Text viewer**: The text viewer is used when double-clicking on an unknown file type.
- **Script editor**: The [script IDE](/Manual/scripting/script_editor/README.md) can be configured to use an external editor rather than the internal one.
