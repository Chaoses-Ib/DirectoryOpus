# Marked Pictures

These options control [image marking](/Manual/additional_functionality/viewing_images/image_marking.md) in the [standalone viewer](/Manual/additional_functionality/viewing_images/README.md).

- **Check for marked pictures when viewer is opened**: The viewer will check if any images in the folder have already been marked in a previous session.
- **Display Marked Pictures pane when a picture is marked**: When you mark an image in the viewer, the *Marked Pictures* pane will open automatically. If this option is turned off you can still open the pane manually.
- **Save marked images to a file collection**: By default, Opus records images you mark to a file collection. This option lets you configure the name of that collection. The default, `Marked Pictures\%F` uses `%F` to insert the name of the current folder. You can also use `%D` to insert the current date. If you turn this option off, the viewer will use [checkbox mode](/Manual/basic_concepts/selecting_files/selecting_with_the_mouse_and_keyboard/checkbox_mode.md) in the parent Lister to indicate images that you mark.
  - **Ask for collection name**: The viewer will prompt you to enter a name for the collection when you begin a new marking session.
  - **Open collection when viewer is closed**: After you mark some images and close the viewer, the collection will be automatically opened in a new tab.
