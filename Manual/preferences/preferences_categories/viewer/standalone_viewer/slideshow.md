# Slideshow

These options affect the [standalone image viewer](/Manual/additional_functionality/viewing_images/README.md).

- **Automatic slideshow**: The viewer will go into slideshow mode whenever it opens with more than one image in the picture list.
- **Randomize slideshow**: This option randomizes the order of pictures in the list when displaying a slideshow.
- **Slideshow speed**: This lets you control the speed in seconds between each image. You canÂ use fractions of a second if desired.
