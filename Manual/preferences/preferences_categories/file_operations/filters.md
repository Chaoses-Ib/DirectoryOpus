# Filters

This page lets you define and edit filters that can be used by various functions in Opus (for example, **Copy File** and **Delete** can use filters to control which files in sub-folders are affected, the [Advanced Find](/Manual/basic_concepts/searching_and_filtering/find_files/advanced_find/RAEDME.md) tool uses filters to define what to search for, etc.). While you can usually edit filters directly when using them in the various functions, this page provides a central repository of stored filters.

Use the toolbar buttons at the top of the page to manage filters: ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_add.png) (add a new filter), ![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_duplicate.png) (duplicate an existing filter), ![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_rename.png) (rename a filter), ![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_desc.png) (assign a description to a filter) and ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_delete.png) (delete a filter). Filters that you create in here will be available for selection via a drop-down list in the various tools that use them, and some commands also accept the name of a pre-defined filter given via command line argument.

For instructions on how to actually define a filter, please see the [Filtered Operations](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/filtered_operations/RAEDME.md) page.
