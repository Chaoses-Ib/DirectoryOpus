# Music Genres

This page lets you configure a list of music genres that's shown in the dropdown for the *Genre* field in the [metadata pane](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/metadata_pane.md). A number of genres are pre-defined but you can remove them if you don't need them, and also add your own.

The **Unused genres** list shows the defined genres that won't be listed, and the **Listed genres** list shows the ones that will be.

Use the ![](/Manual/images/media/13/arrow_left.png) and ![](/Manual/images/media/13/arrow_right.png) buttons to move genres between the two lists. You can also double-click a genre to move it to the other list.

You can change the order of the genres in the **Listed genres** list using the ![](/Manual/images/media/13/arrow_up.png) and ![](/Manual/images/media/13/arrow_down.png) buttons.

The ![](/Manual/images/media/13/sort_button.png) sort button can be used to resort the genres list alphabetically if the order has been changed.

To add a custom genre, enter it in the field at the bottom of the **Unused genres** list and click the ![](/Manual/images/media/13/arrow_right.png) button.
