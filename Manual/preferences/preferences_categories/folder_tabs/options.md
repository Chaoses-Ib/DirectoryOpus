# Options

This page contains options that control the appearance and behavior of [Folder Tabs](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/tabs/RAEDME.md).

- **Click selected tab**: Controls what happens when you click the already selected tab.  
  \* **Rename tab**: The tab will go into inline rename mode, letting you assign a custom label to it.
  - **Go to previous**: Clicking the already selected tab will activate the previously selected tab.
  - **Do nothing**: Clicking the tab does nothing.  
    \* **Display drive letter in tab label**: With this option on, the drive letter will be displayed in the tab along with the name of the folder.

\* **Double-click tabs to close them**: If this option is on, double-clicking a tab with the left button will close it.  
\* **Drag over tabs brings them to the front after**: Lets you adjust the time you have to hover over a tab while dragging a file before the tab comes to the front. If you turn this option off then dragging over tabs won't bring them to the front at all.  
\* **Folder tab close buttons**: This option causes close buttons to be displayed in each tab (whenever there is more than one tab open). If this is turned off, you can still close tabs by double-clicking them (if the above option is on), using the file display's close button, by clicking them with the middle mouse button (if you have one) or by right-clicking them and choosing **Close Tab** from the context menu. There is also an option to make the close buttons smaller to save space.

\* **Lister close button closes active tab**: If multiple tabs are open, clicking the Lister close button (the main close button for the whole window) will close only the active tab instead of the whole Lister. (A similar option also exists for the [File Display border](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/file_display_border.md) close button, under **[File Displays / Border](../file_displays/file_display_border.md)**.)  
\* **Lister closes when last tab closes**: If this option is enabled then Listers will close when the last tab within them is closed (similar to how web browsers work).  
\* **Locked (Allow Folder Changes) tabs reset as soon as another tab is active**: When turned on, a tab in the *Locked (Allow Folder Changes)* state will go back to the folder it was initially locked in as soon as another tab (in the same tab bar) is activated. Use this if you always want the locked tab to be in its home folder when you come back to it, and have its label indicate that folder as soon as you change away from it. Alternatively, turn this off to be able to temporarily change folders in a locked tab, switch tabs, then come back to the locked tab without its folder resetting. Regardless of this setting, you can always reset the locked tab's folder by clicking the tab when it is already active or using the **Go TABSELECT=home** command.  
\* **Locked tabs try to find existing tabs for double-clicked folders**: When turned on, if you double-click (or push Return on) a folder within a *Locked* tab, it will switch to an existing tab if a tab for the same folder is already open in the same tab bar, only opening a new tab if there isn't one. When turned off, a new tab is always opened, even if one already exists for the same folder.  
\* **Locked tabs cannot be closed individually**: When turned on, locking a tab also protects it from being closed accidentally, in addition to locking it to a particular folder. This generally affects actions and commands which close individual tabs (e.g. middle click, Ctrl-F4, or the close button on a tab) and not ones which affect the whole tab bar (e.g. loading a new folder tab group, or closing the entire window).  
\* **Preserve folder tree expansion when switching tabs**: When this option is on, the expansion state of folders in the Folder Tree will be preserved between tabs. That is, when you switch away from a tab, Opus remembers which folders in the folder tree were expanded and which were collapsed, and restores this state when you switch back to that tab.  
\* **Process file changes in background tabs**: When this option is turned on, tabs that aren't visible still process any file changes that occur in the folder they're displaying. If you turn it off, changes won't be processed for non-visible tabs - instead, the tab will be marked as dirty and automatically reloaded when you switch back to it. Turning off background change processing can enhance performance when you're working with lots of tabs simultaneously.**\\**

- **Treat tab label as folder when dragged or right-clicked**: Normally you can drag tabs around, or access their context menu, by clicking anywhere on the tab. If this option is turned on, the tab is split into two parts for the purpose of mouse clicks. The icon acts as the hotspot for the tab, and the label acts as the hotspot for the folder displayed on the tab. So with this option on, you need to click and drag the icon if you want to drag the tab, or right-click the icon if you want to access the tab's context menu. Right-clicking the label will display the context menu for the folder, not the tab, and dragging from the label will represent a drag of the actual folder, which lets you copy the folder or create a shortcut to it using drag and drop.
