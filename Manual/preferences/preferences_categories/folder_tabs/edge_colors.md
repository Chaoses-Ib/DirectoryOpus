# Edge Colors

Folder tabs can display color accents along their edges to help you identify specific folders.

You can configure this for specific folders or use a wildcard to match multiple paths. When you add a folder to the list (or select one that's already listed), use the **Edge color** field at the bottom to set its color. You can also click on the color preview shown in the list to edit it directly.

The **Apply settings to all sub-folders** option applies the same color to all sub-folders of the selected folder, unless overridden by another entry in the list.
