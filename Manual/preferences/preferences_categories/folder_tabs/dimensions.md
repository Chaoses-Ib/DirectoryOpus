# Dimensions

This page contains options that control the sizes of [Folder Tabs](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/tabs/README.md).

### Horizontal tabs

When tabs run along the top or bottom of the Lister, these options apply.

- **Same size tabs**: Instead of sizing automatically to fit their label, tabs will all be the same width. There are two ways this can work:         
  - **Automatic size**: Tabs are all the same width, but this width is determined automatically to fit the widest label.
  - **Fixed size**: Tabs will all be the width in pixels that you specify here.
- **Maximum tab size**: The maximum width of a tab, in pixels. Tabs will never be wider than the width you set here.
- **Minimum tab size**: The minimum width of a tab, in pixels. Tabs will never be narrower than the width you set here.
- **Reduce tab sizes to fit available space**: As the number of tabs increases the size of each tab will be reduced to avoid the tabs overflowing the available space.

### Vertical tabs

When tabs run down the left or right sides of the Lister, these options apply.

- **Automatic width**: The width of the tab bar will change automatically to fit the widest tab.
- **Initial width**: The tab bar won't grow automatically. This specifies its initial width - you can resize it manually with the mouse.
