# Folders Mode

This page lets you select the sources for the [Find-As-You-Type](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/find-as-you-type_field.md) field's *Folders* mode. Folders mode shows a popup list of folders that you can quickly navigate to.

- **Back/forward history**: Includes folders from the back/forward history from either the current tab or all tabs.
- **Favorites**: Includes your [favorite folders](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/favorites_list.md) in the list.
- **Folder aliases (build-in)**: Includes all the built-in [folder aliases](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/frequently_used_paths/folder_aliases.md).
- **Folder aliases (user-defined)**: Includes any folder aliases you've defined yourself.
- **Recent folders**: Includes recent folders (this is a global list and not necessarily the same as the back/forward history).
- **Smart Favorites**: Includes your [SmartFavorites](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/smartfavorites.md).
- **Windows Quick Access folder**: Includes the folders from the Windows *Quick Access* folder (called *Home* in Windows 11).
