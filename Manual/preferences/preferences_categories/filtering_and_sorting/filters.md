# Filters

This page lets you define and edit filters that can be used by various functions in Opus (for example, **Copy File**Â and **Delete** can use filters to control which files in sub-folders are affected, the [Advanced Find](/Manual/basic_concepts/searching_and_filtering/find_files/advanced_find/RAEDME.md) tool uses filters to define what to search for, etc.). While you can usually edit filters directly when using them in the various functions, this page provides a central repository of stored filters.

Use the toolbar buttons at the top of the page to manage filters:

- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/button_add.png) Add a new filter
- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/button_duplicate.png) Duplicate an existing filter
- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/button_rename.png) Rename a filter
- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/button_desc.png) Assign a description to a filter
- ![](/Manual/images/media/13/button_delete.png) Delete a filter
- **Edit as text**: Switches the filter editor to [text mode](/Manual/file_operations/filtered_operations/textual_filters.md).

Filters that you create in here will be available for selection via a drop-down list in the various tools that use them, and some commands also accept the name of a pre-defined filter given via command line argument.

For instructions on how to actually define a filter, please see the [Filtered Operations](/Manual/file_operations/filtered_operations/RAEDME.md) page.
