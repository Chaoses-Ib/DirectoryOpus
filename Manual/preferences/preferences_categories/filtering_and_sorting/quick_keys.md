# Quick Keys

This page lets you configure the keys that invoke the various modes of the FAYT field and the Filter Bar.Â For each of the FAYT modes you can configure a different text and background color, which can provide an important visual cue as to which mode the field is in. For most modes you can also configure the activation key - the key that you press in the file display to show the bar in that mode. For example, the default key for *Command* mode is **\>** so pressing **\>** in a file display would open the FAYT in *Command* mode.

The\*\* FAYT close timeout\*\* option lets you specify how long the FAYT field remains displayed for once you have stopped typing. Not all modes auto-timeout; for example, in *Command* mode the field will remain open until you press **Enter** or **Escape** or click out of the field.

The **Default mode** option lets you configure which option is the "default" - that is, what happens if you press a key that's **not** one of the configured FAYT/Filter Bar keys. The default is *Find* mode, which means if you press, say, the **A** key, the FAYT will open in *Find* mode and the selection will jump to the first filename beginning with an **A**. The activation key field is hidden for the default mode.

See the [Find-As-You-Type](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/find-as-you-type_field.md) documentation for more detail on the FAYT field including a description of its various modes.
