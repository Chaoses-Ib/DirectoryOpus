# Language

This page lets you change the user interface language used by Opus. To change language, select the desired language from the list, and then click the **Change Language** button below. When Opus restarts, the language will be changed. Opus attempts to automatically translate your toolbars and menus as much as possible - any commands from the default toolbars that you haven't edited the label for will be translated to the new language.
