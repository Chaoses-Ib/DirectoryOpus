# Layouts

This page shows a list of your saved [Lister Layouts](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/layouts/RAEDME.md). A Lister Layout is a saved collection of one or more Listers that you can re-open at any time. If you select a layout in this list a tiny preview at the bottom-right of the page gives you an indication of the Listers defined by the layout.

Use the toolbar at the top of the page to edit your layouts. The button are ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_add.png) (add a new layout), ![](/Manual/images/media/layouts_newfolder.png) (new folder), ![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_rename.png) (rename layout), ![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_desc.png) (set description for layout), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_delete.png) (delete layout), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sep.png) (insert a separator), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_up.png) (move layout up), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_down.png) (move layout down), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sort.png) (sort layouts) and ![](/Manual/images/media/layouts_make_shortcut.png) (create shortcut).

- The add button (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_add.png)) saves all currently open Listers as a new layout (or over the top of an existing layout if the name matches one already in use).
- You can organise layouts into folders using the new folder button (![](/Manual/images/media/layouts_newfolder.png)) and by drag & drop.
- The set description button (![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_desc.png)) lets you assign a description to a layout. If you don't assign a description Opus will show a default one based on the settings in the Layout.
- The insert separator (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sep.png)), move up/down (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_up.png)/![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_down.png)) and sort (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sort.png)) buttons are used to add separators to, and change the order of items in, the layout list when it is shown in drop-down menus. The layout list can be accessed from the *Settings / Lister Layouts* menu and if the option is on in the [Windows Integration](../miscellaneous/windows_integration/RAEDME.md) page, by right-clicking the Windows desktop.
- The create shortcut button (![](/Manual/images/media/layouts_make_shortcut.png)) creates a shortcut to the selected layout on your desktop.

The options at the bottom of the page can be modified for each layout in the list:

- **Close all existing Listers when loading this layout**: If this option is on, any existing Listers will be closed automatically when this layout is loaded.
- **Hide this layout from layout lists**: This option lets you mark a layout that is hidden when the layout list is displayed. Layouts that are hidden can still be accessed using the **Prefs LAYOUT** command.
- **Use folder formats saved within this layout**: When you save a Lister layout, the folder formats currently used the file displays are also saved. If you turn this option on, the saved formats will be used when the layout is re-opened. If you turn this option off, the formats will be come from the usual [Folder Formats](../folders/folder_formats/RAEDME.md) system the same as if you navigated to the folders normally.
- **Use toolbars saved within this layout**: When you save a Lister layout, the toolbars currently in use are also saved. If you turn this option on, the saved toolbars will be used when re-opening the layout. If you turn it off, your *Default Toolbar Set* will be used instead. (The *Default Toolbar Set* can be updated via **Settings / Toolbars / Set As Default Toolbar Set**.)
- **Open layout relative to the monitor the mouse is currently on**: Normally a saved layout will re-open its Listers in the same location on-screen they were saved in. If you have a multiple monitor system and turn this option on, the Listers will be opened relative to the monitor the mouse is on (so, for instance, a Lister that was saved on monitor \#1 would open in the same relative location on monitor \#2 if the mouse was on that monitor at the time the layout was opened).

You can open a Lister layout by using the layout list in the *Settings / Lister Layouts* menu or the context menu on the desktop (if the option in [Windows Integration](../miscellaneous/windows_integration/RAEDME.md) is on). You can also create shortcuts to layouts by dragging the layout from the list on this page and dropping it on the desktop.

There is no way to modify the Listers saved in existing layouts - instead, open the layout, make the changes to the Listers as desired, and then re-save it from this page using the add button.
