# Recent List

The **recent list** is an Opus-wide list of your most recently used folders, displayed by default in the ![](/Manual/images/media/13/back_button.png) **Back** button's right-click menu. The options here let you control how many folders are saved in this list:

- **Enable the recent list**: Enables or disables the recent list.
- **Maximum size**: Specify how many folders are remembered. When the limit is exceeded, the oldest folder is removed from the list when a new folder is visited or used.
- **Include virtual folders**: Allows virtual folders like *This PC* to be added to the recent list.
- **Ignore filesystem folders that are only transited**: A folder will only be added to the recent list if you actually do something in it. If you simply pass through a folder on your way to somewhere else, it won't be added to the list.

##### History List

The **history list** is similar to the **recent list** except it's per-tab, not global. It's the list of folders you move through when you click the ![](/Manual/images/media/13/back_button.png) **Back** and ![](/Manual/images/media/13/forward_button.png) **Forward** buttons.

The option at the bottom of the page lets you configure the maximum size of the **history list**.
