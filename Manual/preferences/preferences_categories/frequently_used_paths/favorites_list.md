# Favorites List

This page lets you edit your Favorites list, which is basically the list of folders that is displayed in the Favorites menu in an Opus Lister. You can add as many folders to this list as you like, and they can be arranged in branches (sub-folders) if desired. You can also assign hotkeys to the folders from the list, which lets you access a folder by pressing a key without having to define a separate hotkey for it.

You can see here that we have added a favorite folder. You can assign names to your favorites, so that the full path doesn't have to be displayed in the Favorites menu - here we have named this favorite *Pictures* - the folder it actually points to is displayed at the bottom of the page. We have also assigned a key to it.

The toolbar buttons at the top are how you make changes to the favorites list: ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_add.png) (add new favorite), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorties_-_edit.png) (edit existing favorite), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_delete.png) (delete favorite), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_folder.png) (create a branch for the favorites menu), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sep.png) (insert a separator in the menu), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_up.png) (move favorite up the list), ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_down.png) (move down the list) and ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sort.png) (sort the favorites list). You can also use drag and drop to rearrange the list.

When you edit a favorite (double-click it, or select it and click the ![](/Manual/images/media/favorties_-_edit.png) button) you can assign a name to the favorite, assign a hotkey that lets you access the favorite folder from the keyboard, and also change the path that the favorite refers to.

If you put '&' before a character in the name, that character will become an accelerator key. For example, if you name a favorite *&Videos* and then open the Favorites menu, the V key will activate that item. This is different to adding a hotkey to a favorite: Accelerators only work when the menu is open, while hotkeys are always active even if the menu is closed. If you wish to use a literal & character, use two next to each other: *Cats && Dogs* will display as *Cats & Dogs* in the menu.

By default the favorites list isn't sorted, and new favorites are added to the bottom of the list. You can use the ![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_sort.png) button to sort the list at any time, or turn on the **Automatically sort newly added Favorites** option at the bottom of the page to have new favorites sorted automatically.
