# Background Events

This page lets you configure commands that run when you double-click empty space in the file display. You can configure commands for both left and middle button double-click, optionally with the `Ctrl`, `Shift` or `Alt` keys held down (so up to eight commands in total).

Middle button commands can also be set to trigger on single-click using the dropdown menu.

You can enter any Opus command line into the fields. For example, \<nobr\>\`Go UP BACK\`\</nobr\> to make double-click automatically go back to the parent folder. If you want to run a more complex multi-line command, you can do this by creating a [user command](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/user_commands.md).
