# Info Tips

These options control whether [info tips](/Manual/file_types/filetype_editor/info_tip.md) are shown or not.

- **Enable file Info Tips**: Info tips are the "tooltips" that appear when hovering over files and folders with the mouse. This option lets you enable or disable their display, and also choose for which display modes they appear for.
- **Folder type**: Optionally you can enable info tips only for certain types of drives. For example, you may not want them to appear when on a network folder or FTP site.
- **Keyboard delay**: Lets you display info tips when using Opus with the keyboard - if you hold the `Ctrl` key down for the configured length of time, the info tip for the item with focus will be displayed.
