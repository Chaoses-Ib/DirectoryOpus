# Menus

These options control which items appear in the various drop-down menus of the breadcrumb path field (on the location bar).

- **Archives**: Shows archives in the drop-down menus as if they were folders.
- **Desktop sub-folders**: Shows any folders on the desktop in the *Desktop* branch drop-down.
- **Empty drives**: Shows empty disk drives in the *This PC* branch drop-down.
- **Favorites**: Shows your favorite folders in the *Desktop* branch drop-down.
- **Hidden folders**: Shows hidden folders (ones with the **H** attribute but not the **S** attribute) in the branch drop-down menus.
- **System folders**: Shows protected operating system folders (ones with both the **H** and **S** attributes set) in the branch drop-down menus.
- **Non-drive folders under This PC**: Enable the display of non-drive folders in the drop-down for the *This PC* folder.

Most options default to use the same settings as on the [Folder Tree Contents](../../folder_tree/contents.md) page.
