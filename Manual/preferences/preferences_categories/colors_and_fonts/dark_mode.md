# Dark Mode

Opus maintains two completely separate sets of color and image configuration - one is nominally for "dark mode", and one for "light mode", although you can set the colors to anything you like of course.

This Preferences page lets you select which color set is currently in use.

- **Use system setting** causes Opus to track the Windows dark mode setting (in Windows 10 and above).
- **Dark always** forces Opus to use the "dark mode" color set.
- **Light always** forces Opus to use the "light mode" color set.

You can also switch color sets using the **Dark Mode** command in the default **Settings** menu (it runs the \`Set DARKMODE=toggle\` internal command).
