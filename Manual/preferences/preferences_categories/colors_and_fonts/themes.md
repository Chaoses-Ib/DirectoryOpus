# Themes

Themes let you save just your color, image and font settings as a separate configuration file. You can quickly switch from one theme to another, or share them with others.

The themes list shows your currently installed themes (as well as the default dark and light themes). Select a theme from the list to see a thumbnail preview and information about it.

To create a theme from your current configuration, click the **New** button. You'll be prompted to enter a name and other information like author and a description. You can choose which parts of your configuration are saved in the theme - for example, you can save just colors without affecting fonts if you like.

The *Save New Theme* dialog also lets you provide a preview image which is saved in the theme and is shown when the theme is selected. You can choose this from a file, paste an image from the clipboard or drag the crosshair icon out to select a Lister to take a secure screenshot.

The **Clone** button lets you take the details from an existing theme, although note it doesn't clone that theme's color settings - only the information in the *Save New Theme* dialog is cloned. To make a full duplicate of an existing theme including its color settings, use the **Duplicate** button on the main Preferences page.
