# Themes

Themes let you save just your color, image and font settings as a separate configuration file. You can quickly switch from one theme to another, or share them with others.

The themes list shows your currently installed themes (as well as the default dark and light themes). Select a theme from the list to see a thumbnail preview and information about it.

Use the toolbar to manage your themes. You can use the **Import** and **Export** functions to share themes you've created with others.

##### Creating a new theme

To create a theme from your current configuration, click the **New** button. You'll be prompted to enter a name and other information like author and a description. You can choose which parts of your configuration are saved in the theme - for example, you can save just colors without affecting fonts if you like.

You must provide a number of parameters when saving a theme:

- **Theme Name**: The name of the new theme. This is the name that will be displayed in the themes list in the Lister Themes dialog.
- **Description**: This lets you provide a description of your new theme.
- **Author Info**: You can use this to provide some information about yourself (your name, or a copyright string if desired)
- **URL**: An optional URL that links to information about the theme (or your own website, it's up to you)
- **Preview Image**: This lets you embed a preview image in the theme file. This preview is displayed as a thumbnail in the themes list in the Lister Themes dialog, and as a larger preview when your theme is selected from the list. It's good to provide a preview so that people you share your theme with have some idea of what they're going to get when they apply it.
  You can provide a preview image in three ways:

        * By browsing for an image file
        * By pasting an image from the clipboard
        * By taking a snapshot of an open Lister (drag the crosshair icon out)

- **Content**: These options let you choose which aspects of your configuration are to be included in the theme. For example, you may only want your theme to specify colors and images. The options you check will be included in the theme and when the theme is applied, only those aspects of the configuration will be changed.

Once you've defined your theme click the **OK** button to save it.

##### Cloning an existing theme

The **Clone** button lets you take the details from an existing theme, although note it doesn't clone that theme's color settings - only the information in the *Save New Theme* dialog is cloned. To make a full duplicate of an existing theme including its color settings, use the **Duplicate** button on the main Preferences page.

##### Updating a theme

When you edit an existing theme, the *Edit Theme* dialog has an **Update Content** button on it. This lets you update the settings of an existing theme.
