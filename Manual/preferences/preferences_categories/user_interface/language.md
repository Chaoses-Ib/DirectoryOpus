# Language

This page lets you change the user interface language used by Opus. To change language, select the desired language from the list, and then click the **Change Language** button above the list.

Opus will ask you to confirm the change. You can also choose to automatically translate your toolbars and menus - any commands from the default toolbars that you haven't edited the label for will be translated to the new language.

When Opus restarts, the language will be changed.

### Toolbar glossary

The **Toolbar Glossary** button lets you create a comparative glossary of toolbar commands between the current language and the selected language. If you want to discuss Opus with another user (e.g. on the [forum](https://resource.dopus.com)) you might want to use this command so you can find out what the toolbar button labels are in another language.
