# Sets

This page displays a list of any toolbar sets you have created.

![](/Manual/images/media/toolbar_sets_001.png)

Each set displays the toolbars it contains. You can rename sets and assign custom descriptions using the toolbar icons. For each set you can also use the **Behavior** drop-down to assign a default behavior - when the set is loaded in a Lister the default behavior will be used unless overridden on the command line. The behaviors you can choose from are:

- **Add toolbars to existing toolbars** - any toolbars in the set that aren't already turned on are turned on when the set is loaded. Existing toolbars are unaffected.
- **Replace existing toolbars** - all currently open toolbars are closed and replaced with the toolbars in the set.
- **Toggle existing toolbars** - if all the toolbars in the set are turned on, they are removed and replaced with the toolbars from the default set. Otherwise, any toolbars in the set that aren't currently on are turned on. This option lets you quickly toggle between the default set and another toolbar set.

Toolbar sets are created using the toolbars in an existing Lister as a template. To add a new toolbar set, first pick a Lister and open or close the appropriate toolbars. Then click the **New** button (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_add.png)). The following dialog will open:

![](/Manual/images/media/new_set.png)

To create the set, enter a name for it, and then click on the ![](/Manual/images/media/new_set_drag.png)Â icon and drag it out of the dialog and over the Lister whose current toolbars you want to save into the set. You can also create a set from the Lister itself by right-clicking a toolbar and choosing the *Toolbar Sets / Save Toolbar Set* command from the context menu.

You can duplicate an existing set using the **Duplicate** button (![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_duplicate.png)). Use the **Rename** button (![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_rename.png)) to rename a set, the **Description** button (![](/Manual/images/media/filters_-_desc.png)) to assign your own description, and the **Delete** button (![](/Manual/images/media/favorites_-_delete.png)) to delete a set.
