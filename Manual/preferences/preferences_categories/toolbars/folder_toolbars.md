# Folder Toolbars

This page lets you configure toolbars to open automatically when you navigate to certain folders.

You can use the **Add Folder** button to add a specific folder, and **Add Wildcard** to specify a wildcard pattern that will match target folders. The list shows any folders you've configured, as well as entries for system folders and specific content types.

Each item in the list has a checkbox that must be turned on to enable it. The toolbar or toolbar set to open can be selected from the controls below the list. If you select a toolbar (rather than a set) you can also choose where it should open.
