##### Directory Opus 13 - Detailed release notes

# Lister Defaults

- New, combined UI for saving how the main window is configured.
- Accessed via Settings \> Set Lister Defaults.
- Can set the default view mode and file display columns, which many had trouble with in the past.
- Can also set the window size and which panels and toolbars are on.
- You can choose which elements to save.
- *Command:* \`Prefs SETLISTERDEFAULTS\` -- Opens the new UI. (Old \`Prefs SETDEFAULTLISTER\` still works, for compatibility.)
