##### Directory Opus 13 - Detailed release notes

# Default Toolbars & Menus

- General:
  - The Customize dialog's Default Toolbars tab (discussed above) provides a way to highlight new commands. (See [Customize](customize.md).)
  - If you have custom toolbars and don't want to reset them, you can drag individual items out of the Default Toolbars tab.
- Middle-click to open in a new tab:
  - Most buttons which go to folders now support middle-click to open in a new tab.
  - If a tab for the folder already exists, it will be activated instead of opening a new tab, unless it is already the active tab, in which case a second tab for it will open.
  - Similarly, right-click opens a context menu for the target folder.
  - This functionality automatically applies to any simple button which runs (or generates) a command to go to a specific path.
  - Includes the Up (Parent), Back and Forward buttons.
  - Includes Favorites, Recent, Drive Buttons, and menus generated via "Go FOLDERCONTENTS".
  - Does not include commands that use conflicting arguments like MULTIFUNC, NEW, NEWTAB, etc.
  - Does not include "three-Buttons", which have explicit middle-click or right-click actions.
- "Menu" toolbar:
  - Edit \> Copy Other \> Checksums -- Now a submenu, and includes the BLAKE3 algorithm.
  - Edit \> Calculate BLAKE3 Checksums -- Calculates and shows BLAKE3 hashes in the file display.
  - Edit \> Select Other \> Select Empty Folders.
  - Edit \> Select Other \> Select Zero-Byte Folders.
  - Edit \> Select Other \> Select Expanded Folder Items -- After expanding one or more folders, use this to select everything below them. (See Expandable Folders under [File Display](file_display.md).)
  - Edit \> Select Other \> Select Duplicates -- The same as the [Duplicate Files](duplicates.md) "Select" button. Useful if the panel is hidden.

    - Default button code updated to scale thumbnail size with DPI.

  - Folder \> Expandable Folders -- Toggles the ability to use Expandable Folders. Turning them off saves a little space.

  - Copy Files \> Copy Settings -- Shortcut to the corresponding Preferences page.
  - New Folder \> Move to New Folder -- Prompts for a name and moves all selected items into a new sub-folder.
  - New Folder \> Move to Dated Folder -- Moves all selected items into a new sub-folder with YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS name for natural sorting. (Not technically new, but in a new place.)
  - Delete \> Empty Recycle Bin -- Empties the Recycle Bin.
  - Delete \> Secure Empty Recycle Bin -- Does a multi-pass "secure" erase of the Recycle Bin.

  - There are also new top-level buttons to toggle Lister-Linked, and (if fullscreen) move to other monitors.
- Context menus:
  - Context menus that contain "Open Containing Folder" now include a second "...in New Tab" option. (Removed unnecessary "open container in tabs" setting.)
  - The "Column Header" context menu has several changes to support new grouping and column-freezing functionality. We recommend resetting your copy to the defaults if they are missing.
  - "Folder Tabs" context menu is new. This used to be a hardcoded menu and can now be edited.
