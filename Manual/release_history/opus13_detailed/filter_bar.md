### Directory Opus 13 - Detailed release notes

# Filter Bar

- Several options (e.g. regex vs wildcards, partial matching) can now be configured from the filter bar without opening Preferences.
- Main edit control dropdown now shows a history of previous used patterns.
  - To clear, right-click the edit control and choose Clear History.
  - Alternatively, hold Shift and click the Clear button next to the control.
- "File Extensions" button, left of the edit control, lets you filter by extension or file type group, as before.
- File extensions in the menu are now disabled if they're already included via a file type group.
- Easier logic when in "any word" mode. See *Find* \> *Simple Mode* \> *Enhancements to "any word" matching* in these release notes for details.
