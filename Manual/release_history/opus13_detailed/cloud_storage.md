##### Directory Opus 13 - Detailed release notes

# Cloud Storage

- Cloud folders now grouped together in the folder tree.
- Workaround for Dropbox's nonstandard sync attributes.
- Added a "Special Folders" page to Preferences. Displays a list of all the "special folders" that appear on the desktop and let you a) mark them as cloud storage or not (determines whether they go into the Cloud Storage folder in the tree), and b) hide/show them selectively in the tree and file display. The "cloud_sync_paths" option from Misc / Advanced has also moved here.
- More control over where and whether cloud folders are displayed in the folder tree and file display.
- Commands:
  - \`SetAttr PIN\` -- The same as right-clicking and choosing "Always keep on this device".
  - \`SetAttr DEHYDRATE\` -- The same as right-clicking and choosing "Free up space".
