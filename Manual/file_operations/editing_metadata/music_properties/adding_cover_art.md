# Adding Cover Art

The **Cover art** metadata field shown for music files lets you add, remove and extract cover art from music files.

The **Cover art** field displays a (tiny) thumbnail of any cover art images currently in the selected file. Music files can store more than one image; you can theoretically add an unlimited number of images, although it would be very unusual to have more than one or two.

To add a new cover art image, click the **Add** button and select the image file you want to use. If you have an image on the clipboard you can also click the **Paste** button to add it directly instead of saving it to a file first.

Once the image has been added you can move the mouse over it as described above and set the type and description of the image as required. Cover art images can only be **JPG** or **PNG** format, so if you choose an image in another format Opus will convert it to **JPG** automatically.

Moving the mouse over one of the tiny cover art thumbnails displays a larger image in a pop-up window. From the keyboard you can bring this up by putting the focus on the thumbnail (with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key) and pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

The pop-up displays the resolution and size of the image at the top. The drop-down at the bottom lets you change the "type" of the image. Cover art can be assigned a type to represent its role in the real world as cover art ("back cover", "front cover", etc). The type is used when choosing a thumbnail to show for the music file in a Lister - if there are multiple image types defined, usually the "front cover" is the one that's shown for the file's thumbnail.

The **Delete** button at the bottom lets you remove the cover art image.

  You can also right-click on the pop-up window to display a context menu with additional actions:

- **Type**: The **Type** sub-menu lets you change the image type (as an alternative to the drop-down at the bottom of the image).
- **Set description**: This command lets you assign a description string to the image.
- **Copy**: The **Copy** command will copy the image data to the clipboard - from there you can paste it into a paint program, or into a Lister to create a new image file.
- **Extract image**: Extracts the image to a disk file.
- **Delete**: Removes the cover art image.
