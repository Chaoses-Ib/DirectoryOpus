# Music Properties

The **Music Properties** metadata fields apply to music files - the formats that Opus currently supports are **MP3** and **WMA**. Several **Music** fields also apply to [video](video_properties.md) files as well.

- **Album**: The title of the album that this music appears on.
- **Album artist**: The album artist. How you use this field is up to you - normally this is used for compilation albums where each individual track may have a different artist.
- **Artists**: The artist or artists responsible for this track. This is the same field (renamed) as the **Authors [Document Properties](document_properties.md)** field. To specify multiple artists, separate them with a semi-colon (this method of supplying multiple values is used in a number of different metadata fields).
- **Author URL**: A URL associated with the artist (this might be the URL of the band's website, for example).
- **BPM**: The tempo of the music, in beats-per-minute.
- **Composers**: The composer or composers of the music. To specify multiple composers, separate them with a semi-colon.
- **Conductors**: The conductor or conductors of the music. To specify multiple conductors, separate them with a semi-colon.
- **Content group**: This field lets you group different tracks together, for example for classical music that has distinct movements. An MP3 of the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony might have "Sym. No. 9 in D" for **Content Group**, while **Title** would be "Presto-O Freunde, nicht diese Tone-Allegro assai".
- **Copyright**: A copyright message for the music.
- **Cover art**: This field lets you [add and edit album cover art](/Manual/file_operations/editing_metadata/music_properties/adding_cover_art.md) - images representing the "cover art" (CD cover, etc) of the music.
- **Disk number**: For multiple-disk sets, this lets you specify the disk number that this music appeared on.
- **Encoded by**: This field is generally used for the name of the person who encoded the track, or the name of the software application they used to do it.
- **Genre**: The genre of the music. You can select from the drop-down list of a number of common genres, or enter your own.
- **Initial key**: This is used to indicate the initial musical key of the track, e.g. **G#m**.
- **Mood**: Use this to specify the mood of the music (e.g. "background music", "party", etc.)
- **Original artists**: The original artists of the track. This can be used to specify the name of the original artist or artists in a cover version that was recorded by someone else. To specify multiple artists, separate them with a semi-colon.
- **Publisher**: The publisher of the music.
- **Release date**: The date the music was originally released.
- **Subtitle**: The **Subtitle** description is used to provide additional information relating to the **Title**, for example if the title was "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2", the subtitle might be "Live in Berlin".
- **Title**: The title of the music.
- **Track number**: The track number of the music if it forms part of a multi-track work (i.e. an album). You can specify just a track number, or also specify the total number of tracks (e.g. the track number could be **5**, or it could be **5 / 15**).

The **Increment** option in this field lets you assign automatically incrementing track numbers when you have multiple files selected. The track number you enter will be assigned to the first selected file, and the number will be incremented once for each additional file. You can also specify that you want to the track number zero-padded by entering a leading zero in the **Track number** field.

- **Year**: The year the music was originally released.
