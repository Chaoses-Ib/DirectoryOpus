# Find and Replace

Similar to the way the Find and Replace function in a text editor works, *Find and Replace* mode lets you perform a batch rename by specifying a text string to search for and another to replace it with.

This example has the **Find** string (note the **Old name** field has been replaced with **Find**) set to *img*, and the **Replace** string is set to *IMG*. The preview list indicates the outcome of the batch rename - as you can see, only two of the displayed files will actually change as a result of the rename (they are the two displayed in black - the rest, in grey, won't change).

Ordinarily the search is confined to the filename stem, excluding the file extension. If the **Ignore extension** option is turned off, however, the *Find and Replace* operation will be performed over the whole filename including the extension.
