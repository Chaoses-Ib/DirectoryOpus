# Rename Scripts

This is by far the most powerful, but also most complicated, feature of the Advanced Rename dialog. Using VBScript, JScript or other ActiveX scripting languages, you can write a rename function that gives you complete control over the outcome of the rename operation.

Click the **Edit Script** button in the actions section of the Rename dialog to display the script editor.

The script editor will pop-out to the right of the dialog. The drop-down at the top of the script editor lets you choose the script language to use.

Note that a script can be defined (and have effect) even if the editor isn't visible. As shown in theÂ screenshot above, the words **Script defined** will be displayed to indicate that a script is active. The drop-down attached to the **Hide Scipt** button gives you a clear command which lets you clear out the script contents.

See the [Rename Scripts](/Manual/scripting/rename_scripts/README.md) page in the [Scripting](/Manual/scripting/README.md) section for more information about writing rename scripts.
