# File Operations

While Opus has a lot of features, its file management functions are the most important (it is a file manager, after all!). Please see the following sections on the core file management functions:

- **[Copying, Moving and Deleting Files](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/README.md)**: Probably the most fundamental file management functions, this includes information on using [copy-and-paste](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copy_and_paste.md), [drag-and-drop](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/drag_and_drop.md) and the [source and destination](basic_concepts/source_and_destination.md) concept to move files around.
- **[Renaming Files](/Manual/file_operations/renaming_files/README.md)**: Opus supports quick renaming of files by editing their names directly, and can also perform complicated wildcard and scripted renames.
- **[Creating Folders](/Manual/file_operations/creating_folders.md)** and **[Creating Archives](/Manual/file_operations/creating_archives/README.md)**: Information on how to make new folders and archive files.
- **[Changing Attributes](/Manual/file_operations/changing_attributes.md)**: Opus makes it easy to modify file and folder attributes and timestamps.
- **[Labels](/Manual/file_operations/labels.md)**, **[Metadata](/Manual/file_operations/editing_metadata/README.md)** and **[Descriptions](/Manual/file_operations/file_descriptions.md)**: Describes the ways Opus can help you categorize and keep track of your files.
- **[UAC and Administrator Mode](/Manual/file_operations/uac_and_administrator_mode.md)**: Opus provides full support for UAC in Windows Vista and later.
