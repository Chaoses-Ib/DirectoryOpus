# Copying, Moving and Deleting Files

The most fundamental feature of a file manager is its ability to let you move files around. Opus provides several ways to copy and move files from one folder to another:

- [Copy-and-paste](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copy_and_paste.md): This is the traditional method on Windows of moving files around using the clipboard.
- [Drag-and-drop](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/drag_and_drop.md): Again, fairly standard on Windows; using the mouse to drag files from one folder to another.
- [Toolbar buttons](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copying_using_the_toolbar_buttons/RAEDME.md): Several default toolbar buttons let you copy or move selected files.

Other file copying-related features include:

- The [copy queue](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copy_queues/RAEDME.md) function, which lets you queue multiple file copy operations to avoid disk thrashing or bandwidth contention.
- Files can be renamed as they are copied, either one at a time or using [wildcards](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copying_using_the_toolbar_buttons/using_wildcards_when_copying.md).
- When filename collisions occur, the [replace dialog](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/the_confirm_file_replace_dialog.md) lets you quickly choose what you want to do.
- Powerful features for [synchronizing](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/the_confirm_file_replace_dialog.md) the contents of two folders (including remote FTP sites).
- A [filtering system](filtered_operations/RAEDME.md) that lets you selectively copy the contents of folders

[Deleting files](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/RAEDME/deleting_files/RAEDME.md) is also a part of the basic file management tool set - Opus also provides a [secure delete](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/deleting_files/secure_delete.md) function to securely erase data.
