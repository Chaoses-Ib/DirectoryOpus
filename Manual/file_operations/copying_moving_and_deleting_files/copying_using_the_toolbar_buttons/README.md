# Copying using the toolbar buttons

The third way of copying files, besides copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop, is to use the **Copy Files** and **Move** buttons on the toolbar.

These buttons make use of the [source and destination](/Manual/basic_concepts/source_and_destination.md) concept. Selected files will be copied or moved from the current source folder to the current destination - or, if there is no current destination folder, Opus will prompt you to select the destination folder.

##### Copy Files

 The drop-down menu attached to the **Copy Files** button contains the following file copy commands:

- **Copy Files**: Copy selected files and folders to the destination folder.
- **Copy As**: Lets you enter new filenames or provide a wildcard pattern to [rename files as they are copied](/Manual/file_operations/copying_moving_and_deleting_files/copying_using_the_toolbar_buttons/using_wildcards_when_copying.md)
- **Duplicate**: Makes copies (duplicates) of selected files in the same folder.
- **Duplicate to Dated Names**: Makes copies of selected files with the current date appended to their names.
- **Update All**: Updates all files. Only files that don't exist in the destination, or exist but are newer, will be copied. See [Copying Updated Files](copying_updated_files/README.md) for more information.
- **Update Existing**: Updates existing files. Only files that already exist in the destination and are newer will be copied. See [Copying Updated Files](copying_updated_files/README.md) for more information.
- **Create Shortcuts**: Creates shortcuts in the destination folderÂ (.lnk) that point to the selected files. See [Making Links and Junctions](/Manual/additional_functionality/making_links_and_junctions.md) for more information.
- **Create Advanced Links**: Creates junctions and softlinks in the destination folder that point to the selected files. See [Making Links and Junctions](/Manual/additional_functionality/making_links_and_junctions.md) for more information.
- **Send To**: This displays the standard system *Send To* menu that lets you send selected files to various locations.
- **Enable Copy Filter**: Turns on the [recursive filter](../filtered_operations/README.md), which lets you selectively copy the contents of sub-folders.
- **Copy Settings**: Opens the [Copying Files](/Manual/preferences/preferences_categories/file_operations/copying_files/README.md) Preferences page.
