# Regular Expression Syntax

Regular expressions are a more powerful (and therefore complicated) form of wildcard pattern matching. Like [standard pattern matching](pattern_matching_syntax.md), they can be used throughout Opus. Generally, you have to specifically enable the use of regular expressions in a given situation - by default, Opus will assume standard pattern matching. For example, the **[Advanced Rename](/Manual/file_operations/renaming_files/advanced_rename/RAEDME.md)** dialog has a regular expression mode that you must select before regular expressions can be used.

One advantage regular expressions have over standard pattern matching is they can enable a form of search and replace in certain functions. As an example, this is used in the **Rename** command. The "search" string is specified as a pattern to match against the original names of files. That pattern can indicate *capture groups* - expressions in the source string that are captured, and can be carried over to the new string (which acts as the "replace" string). As an example, imagine the **Rename** dialog is set to regular expression mode, with the following patterns supplied:

**Old Name**: The (.\*) Backup\\(.\*)  
**New Name**: \1.\2

  
The two **(.\*)** tokens in the *old name* string are capture groups - they "capture" whatever is matched by the expression within the parentheses. In this case, the expression inside the brackets is **.**\* which simply means "match anything". So what this pattern will do is match any filename beginning with *The* and ending in *Backup*, and it will capture the middle of the filename for later use. The second **(.\*)** will capture the file extension. The *new name* string can then re-use the captured text, and this is indicated with the **\1** and **\2** markers. So as an example, the original filename *The Lord Of The Rings Backup.avi* would be renamed to *Lord Of The Rings.avi*. **\1** refers to the first capture group, **\2** to the second, and so on.

If you need the *new name* string to contain a literal \\ use two together. For example, *abc\\xyz* will turn into *abc\xyz*.

When used with the **Rename** command only, the *old name* pattern can be followed with a **\#** character to indicate that the search and replace operation should be repeated multiple times. For example, the following regular expression rename will remove all spaces from the filename:

**Old Name**: (.\*)\s(.\*)#  
**New Name**: \1\2

  
The **\#** causes the search and replace to be repeated until the new name no longer changes. You can also specify a maximum repetition count by appending a number, for example **\#5** at the end would repeat the operation no more than five times.

There are many different variants of regular expression; by default Opus uses what's called *TR1 ECMAScript*. Microsoft has a [page on TR1](http://www.gpsoft.com.au/DScripts/redirect.asp?page=regex) that goes into far more detail than this help file can.

| Token | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **^** | **Start of a string**.  <br />The caret is used to "anchor" the search to the start of the string. If the search is not anchored to either end, the pattern can match a sub-string of the target.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**^abc** matches *abc*, *abcdefg*, *abc123*, but not *123abc\\* **abc** also matches// 123abc// |
| **\$** | **End of a string**.  <br />The dollar sign is used to "anchor" the search to the end of the string. If the search is not anchored to either end, the pattern can match a sub-string of the target.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**abc\$** matches *abc*, *endsinabc*, *123abc*, but not *abc123*  <br />**^abc(.\*)123\$** matches *abc123*, *abcxyz123*, but not *abcxyz123def* |
| **.** | **Any single character**.  <br />The period (full stop) is used to match any single character.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**a.c** matches *abc*, *aac*, *acc*, *adc* but not *acd* |
| \* | **0 or more of previous expression**.  <br />Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous expression. Combine with **.** to form the "match anything" token (**.**\*).<br /><br />For example:  <br />**ab\*c** matches *ac*, *abc*, *abbc*, *abbbc*, ...  <br />**a.\*c** matches *ac*, *abc*, *a123456c*, *aanythingc*, ...  <br />**.**\* matches anything |
| **+** | **1 or more of previous expression**.  <br />Matches one or more occurrences of the previous expression.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**ab+c** matches *abc*, *abbc*, *abbbc* but not *ac* |
| **?** | **0 or 1 of previous expression**.  <br />Matches either zero or one occurrence of the previous expression.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**ab?c** matches *ac*, *abc* but not *abbc* or *abbbc* |
| **\\|** | **Alternation (logical *or*).**  <br />The vertical bar is used to separate two or more characters or expressions, any of which may match.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**a\\|b** matches *a* or *b*  <br />**a(b\\|c)d** matches *abd* or *acd*  <br />**(bill\\|ted)** matches *bill* or *ted* |
| **{}** | **Quantifier**.  <br />Braces are used to indicate that the preceding expression must match an exact number of times.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**ab{2}c** matches *abbc*, but not *abc* or *abbbc*  <br />**a.{4}z** matches *abcdez*, *a1234z*, *afourz*, *aaaaaz*, etc. |
| **\[\]** | **Character set**.  <br />Matches any single character in the set of specified characters.  <br />You can specify the character set as individual characters (e.g. **\[abdfg\]**) or as a range of characters (e.g. **\[a-j\]**) or as multiple ranges.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**\[abc\]** matches either *a*, *b* or *c*  <br />**\[af-j\]** matches either *a*, *f*, *g*, *h* or *j*  <br />**\[a-dh-kq-\]** matches *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *h*, *i*, *j*, *k*, or any character from *q* onwards  <br />**IMGP\[0-9\]{4}.jpg** matches *IMGP0158.jpg* (or any other four-digit number). |
| **\[^\]** | **Negative character set**.  <br />Matches any character **not** in the set of specified characters. See **\[\]** for information on how the set is defined.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**\[^pqr\]** matches any character except *p*, *q* or *r* |
| **()** | **Expression / capture group**.  <br />Parentheses are used to combine multiple characters into an expression. When used in a "search and replace" like Advanced Rename, they also mark capture groups - see above for a discussion of these.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**a\\|bc** matches *ac* or *bc*, whereas  <br />**a\\|(bc)** matches *a* or *bc* |
| **\\** | **Escape character**.  <br />The backslash is used to escape token characters in order to match those characters literally.  <br />When used before a non-token character, it is used to indicate the following special escape characters:  <br />\<WRAP\><br /><br />\|        \|                                                                                                            \|<br />\|--------\|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\|<br />\| **\t** \| tab character (\$09)                                                                                       \|<br />\| **\r** \| carriage return (\$0d)                                                                                     \|<br />\| **\v** \| vertical tab (\$0b)                                                                                        \|<br />\| **\f** \| form feed (\$0c)                                                                                           \|<br />\| **\n** \| new line (\$0a)                                                                                            \|<br />\| **\e** \| escape (\$1b)                                                                                              \|<br />\| **\x** \| matches an ASCII character specified as a two-digit hexadecimal number, e.g. **\x20** matches a space      \|<br />\| **\u** \| matches a Unicode character specified as a four-digit hexadecimal number, e.g. **\u0020** matches a space. \|<br /><br />\</WRAP\>\<wrap clear/\><br /><br />It is also used to mark several character classes, which are shorthand ways to specify various common **\[\]** character sets (see below).<br /><br />For example:  <br />**a\\|b** matches *a* or *b*, whereas  <br />**a\\b** matches *a\\|b\\* **a\t** matches *a* followed by a tab character, whereas  <br />**a\\t** matches *a\t* |
| **  \w** | **Word character**.  <br />Matches any word character. Equivalent to **\[a-zA-Z_0-9\]**.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**^\w+\[0-9\]{4}.jpg** matches *IMGP0158.jpg* (or any other four-digit number preceded by at least one other word character). |
| **  \W** | **Non-word character**.  <br />Matches any non-word character, equivalent to **\[^a-zA-Z_0-9\]**. |
| **  \s** | **Space character**.  <br />Matches any whitespace character. Equivalent to **\[ \f\n\r\t\v\]**. |

| **  \d** | **Digit character**.  <br />Matches any decimal digit. Equivalent to **\[0-9\]**. |
| **  \D** | **Non-digit character**.  <br />Matches any non-decimal digit. Equivalent to **\[^0-9\]**.<br /><br />For example:  <br />**^\D+\d{4}.jpg** matches *IMGP0158.jpg* (or any other four-digit number preceded by at least one non-digit character). |
