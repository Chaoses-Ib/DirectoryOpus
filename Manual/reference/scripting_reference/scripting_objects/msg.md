# Msg

The **Msg** object represents a [script dialog](/Manual/scripting/script_dialogs/RAEDME.md) input event message. It’s returned by the **[Dialog](dialog.md).GetMsg** method which you call when running the message loop for a [detached dialog](/Manual/scripting/script_dialogs/the_dialog_message_loop/detached_dialogs.md).

| Property Name | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *\<default value\>* | *bool* | Returns **True** if the message is valid, or **False** if the dialog has been closed (which means you should exit your message loop). |
| buttons | *string* | Returns a string indicating which mouse button was pressed when the message was generated. Possible values are **left**, **right** and **middle**. |
| checked | *int* | If the event type is **checked**, this indicates the check state of the item. If checkboxes are used in automatic mode, this will be the **new** check state of the item. In manual mode, this will indicate the **existing** state and it's up to you to change the state if desired.<br /><br />Check states are:<br /><br />\|       \|                        \|<br />\|-------\|------------------------\|<br />\| **0** \| unchecked              \|<br />\| **1** \| checked                \|<br />\| **2** \| indeterminate          \|<br />\| **3** \| unchecked/disabled     \|<br />\| **4** \| checked/disabled       \|<br />\| **5** \| indeterminate/disabled \| |
| control | *string* | Returns the name of the control involved in the event. You can get a **[Control](control.md)** object representing the control by passing this string to the **[Dialog](dialog.md).Control** method.<br /><br />- For a **timer** event this returns the name of the timer that was triggered.<br />- For a **hotkey** event this returns the name of the hotkey.<br />- For a **drop** event this returns the name of the control that the files were dropped on.<br />- For a **tab** event this tells you which monitored tab the event occurred in (either the ID you assigned in the **[Dialog](dialog.md).WatchTab** method, or the numeric handle of the tab if you didn't assign an ID).<br />- For a **dirchange** event this tells you which watcher detected a file or folder change (the ID you assigned via the **[Dialog](dialog.md).WatchDir** method).<br />- If you have added an icon to the taskbar via the **[Dialog](dialog.md).NotifyIcon** method, **notifyicon** indicates an event associated with that icon. |
| cx | *int* | For **resize** events, this property returns the new width of the dialog. |
| cy | *int* | For **resize** events, this property returns the new height of the dialog. |
| data | *int* or// bool// | If the event type is **focus**, indicates the new focus state of the control - **True** if the control has gained the focus, or **False** if it's lost it.<br /><br />For a *combo box* or *list box* control: If the event type is **selchange** or **dblclk**, returns the data value associated with the selected item.<br /><br />For a two-state *check box* control or *radio button*: If the event type is **click**, returns a *bool* indicating the current check state.<br /><br />For a three-state *check box*: If the event type is **click**, returns an *int* representing the current state.<br /><br />If the event type is **timer**, this value indicates the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the last time this timer was triggered.<br /><br />If the event type is **tab**, and the **value** property is set to **filechange**, this indicates which file change events occurred in the monitored tab. **1** = add, **2** = delete, **4** = change. The values will be added together (so e.g. **6** indicates at least one item was changed and at least one was deleted). |
| dialog | *string* | Returns the name of the parent dialog. |
| event | *string* | Returns a string indicating the event that occurred. Currently defined events are:<br /><br />\|                \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \|<br />\|----------------\|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\|<br />\| **invalid**    \| The dialog has been closed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \|<br />\| **checked**    \| For a listview control with the ***Checkboxes*** property enabled, indicates that the checkbox of a list item has been clicked.                                                                                                                                                                                                           \|<br />\| **click**      \| The control was clicked (e.g. a button, check box, radio button, markup text or static control with ***Notify Clicks*** property enabled).                                                                                                                                                                                                \|<br />\| **close**      \| The user clicked the dialog's close button.

| mousex | *int* | Returns the horizontal position of the mouse cursor when the message was generated. |
| mousey | *int* | Returns the vertical position of the mouse cursor when the message was generated. |
| object | *variant* | For a **drop** event, this property returns a **[Vector](vector.md)** of **[Item](item.md)** objects, representing the files that were dropped onto your dialog. |
| qualifiers | *string* | Returns a string indicating the qualifier keys (if any) that were held down when the message was generated.<br /><br />The string can contain any or all of the following: *shift,* *ctrl*, *alt*, *lwin*, *rwin*<br /><br />If no qualifiers were down, the string will be: *none* |

| tab | *string* | For a dialog tab control, returns the name of the parent tab (if the control is on a dialog that's inside a tab control).<br /><br />If the event type is **tab**, this returns a **[Tab](tab.md)** object representing the monitored tab that the event occurred in. Calling this repeatedly may be inefficient. |
| value | *string* | For the **dblclk**, **editchange** and **selchange** events, returns the current contents of the edit field (or selected item label).<br /><br />For the **tab** event, indicates which event occurred in the monitored tab.
