# Path

The **Path** object represents a file or folder path. Many objects have properties that return a **Path** - for example, **[Tab](tab.md).path** returns the current folder in a tab as a **Path** object. You can create a new **Path** object from a string (or another **Path**) using the **[DOpus](dopus.md).**[FSUtil](fsutil.md)**.NewPath** method.

| Property Name | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *\<default value\>* | *string* | Returns the full path as a string. |
| components | *int* | Returns the number of components in the path. |
| disks | **[Vector](vector.md)***:int* | Returns a **[Vector](vector.md)**of *ints* representing the physical disk drive or drives that this path resides on. |
| drive | *int* | Returns the drive number the path refers to (1=A, 2=B, etc.) or 0 if the path does not specify a drive. You can also change the drive letter of the path (while leaving the following path components alone) by modifying this value. |
| ext | *string* | Returns the filename extension of the path (the sub-string extending from the last **.** in the final component to the end of the string). This method does not check if the path actually refers to a file.<br /><br />You can also change a path's file extension by setting this property (and strip the extension altogether by setting it to an empty string). |
| ext_m | *string* | Returns the filename extension of the path, taking multi-part extensions into account. For example, **ext** might return ".rar" whereas **ext_m** would return ".part1.rar".<br /><br />You can't change the extension using **ext_m**, only **ext**. |
| filepart | *string* | Returns the filename part of the path (the last component). |
| longpath | *object:***Path** | If this object represents a short pathname, this property returns the "long" equivalent. |
| pathpart | *string* | Returns the path minus the last component. |
| shortpath | *object:***Path** | If this object represents a long pathname, this property returns the "short" equivalent, if it has one. Note that short paths are disabled by default in Windows 10. |
| stem | *string* | Returns the filename stem of the path (i.e. **filepart** minus **ext**). |
| stem_m | *string* | Returns the filename stem taking multi-part extensions into account. For example, **stem** might return "pictures.part1" whereas **stem_m** would return "pictures". |
| test_parent | *bool* | Returns **True** if a call to the **Parent** method would succeed. |
| test_root | *bool* | Returns **True** if a call to the **Root** method would succeed. |

| Method Name | **Arguments** | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Add | \<string:name\>  <br />or \<**[Vector](vector.md)***:string\>* | *none* | Adds the specified name to the path (it will become the last component). As well as a string, you can pass a **[Vector](vector.md)** of strings and all items in the vector will be added to the path. |
| Normalize | *none* | *none* | Normalizes the path by:<br /><br />- Converting all forward-slashes to back-slashes (or vice versa for a URL)<br />- Collapsing duplicate slashes to a single slash (except where needed)<br /><br />**Normalize** is automatically called when a new path string is assigned to a **Path** object so you don't normally need to call it manually. |
| Parent | *none* | *bool* | Removes the last component of the path. Returns **False** if the path does not have a valid parent. |
| ReplaceStart | \<string:old\>  <br />\<string:new\>  <br />\<bool:wholepath\> | *bool* | Compares the beginning of the path with the "old" string, and if it matches replaces it with the "new" string. The match is performed at the path component level - for example, an "old" string of "C:\Foo" would match the path "C:\Foo\Bar" but not "C:\FooBar". If the optional *wholepath* argument is set to **True** then the whole path must match rather than just its beginning. Returns **True** if the string matched the path or **False** otherwise. |
| Resolve | \<string:flags\> | *none* | Resolves the specified path string to its real filesystem path, with support for converting:<br /><br />- **[Folder Aliases](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/navigation/aliases.md)** to the real paths they point to.<br />- **Library** and **File Collection** items to their real filesystem paths.<br />- Application paths in the **{apppath\\|*appname*}** form.<br />- Environment variables.<br />- Optionally, **junctions** and **symbolic links** can be resolved to their targets. The **Path** object is modified in-place.<br /><br />It is safe to pass a path which does not need resolving; the path will remain as-is, so you can call this on things without checking if it is needed first.<br /><br />Scripts which pass the current directory to external software should generally call Resolve on the path first, otherwise they risk passing aliases like */desktop* to things which won't understand them.<br /><br />The optional **flags** string can include the following letter (not case-sensitive):<br /><br />\|       \|                                                                 \|<br />\|-------\|-----------------------------------------------------------------\|<br />\| **j** \| resolve **j**unctions and symbolic links to their target folder \|<br /><br />Note that **[DOpus](dopus.md).[FSUtil](fsutil.md)** has a similar **Resolve** method which takes a string input and returns a new **Path** object. |
| Root | *none* | *bool* | Strips off all but the first component of the path. Returns **False** if the path is already at the root. |
| Set | \<string:path\>  <br />or \<**Path**:path\>  <br />or \<**[Vector](vector.md)***:string\>* | *none* | Sets the path represented by the **Path** object to the specified *string*.<br /><br />You can also set one **Path** object to the value of another. If you pass a **[Vector](vector.md)** of strings the path will be built from the items in the vector. |
| Split | \<int:first\>  <br />\<int:count\> | **[Vector](vector.md)***:string* | Returns a **[Vector](vector.md)** of strings representing the components of the path. For example, if the path is **C:\Foo\Bar**, the vector will contain three items - "C:\\, "Foo" and "Bar". By default all components of the path are returned, but you can optionally provide the index of the first component and also the number of components to return. |
| ToUNC | *none* | *bool* | If the path begins with the drive letter of a mapped network drive, it will be converted into the UNC version of the path. For example, "X:\Test" may map to "\\Server\Share\Test". Returns **True** if the path was modified and **False** if it was not. |
