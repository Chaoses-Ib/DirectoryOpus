# TabStats

The **TabStats** object provides various information and statistics about the current folder displayed in a tab. Note that the **[Tab](tab.md)** object provides two versions of this object. **Tab.selstats** takes [Checkbox Mode](/Manual/basic_concepts/selecting_files/selecting_with_the_mouse_and_keyboard/checkbox_mode.md) into account, and in this mode the values of the "checked" and the "selected" properties will be the same. If the object was retrieved via **Tab.stats** and the file display is in Checkbox Mode, the two sets of properties will be different.
