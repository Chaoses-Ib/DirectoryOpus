# OrderedMap

The **OrderedMap** object is an [associative container](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_container) and is identical to the **[Map](map.md)** object except for the ordering of items within the map.

Whereas the regular **Map** object sorts items alphabetically by key, the **OrderedMap** preserves the order that items are added.

You can create a new **OrderedMap** using the **[DOpusFactory](dopusfactory.md).OrderedMap** method. All Opus script methods documented as accepting a **Map** object can also accept an **OrderedMap**.

See the documentation of the **[Map](map.md)** object for more information.
