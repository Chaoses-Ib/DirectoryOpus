# AfterFolderChangeData

If a [script add-in](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/RAEDME.md)implements the **[OnAfterFolderChange](../scripting_events/onafterfolderchange.md)** event, the method receives an **AfterFolderChangeData** object once the folder read is complete.

| path | *object:***[Path](path.md)** | *If the read failed*, this will return a **[Path](path.md)**object representing the path that Opus tried to read.  <br />*If the read was successful, this property is not provided* - instead, the **tab** property provides access to this information.  <br />Use the **result** property to know if the read was a success. |
