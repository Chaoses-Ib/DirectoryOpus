# ScriptFAYTData

The **ScriptFAYTData** object is passed to the script-defined entry points for any [script add-ins](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/RAEDME.md) that [extend the FAYT field](/Manual/scripting/example_scripts/extending_the_fayt.md). The method name for these events is defined by the script itself, but generically it's referred to as **[onscriptfaytcommand](../scripting_events/onscriptfaytcommand.md)**.
