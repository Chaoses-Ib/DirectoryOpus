# OnCloseTab

The **OnCloseTab** event can be implemented by a [script add-in](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/README.md)Â to receive notification when a tab is closed in a Lister.

| **Method Name:** | OnCloseTab |
| --- | --- |
| **Argument Type:** | **[CloseTabData](../scripting_objects/closetabdata.md)** |
| **Return Type:** | *bool* |
| **Description:** | The **CloseTabData.tab** property identifies the tab that is closing. You can return **True** from this event to prevent the tab from closing, or **False** (which is the default) to allow it to close.<br /><br />Note that when a Lister closes this event is **not** triggered for each of its tabs - the **[OnCloseLister](oncloselister.md)** event provides notification when a Lister closes, and all the tabs in that Lister as discoverable through the **CloseListerData.lister.tabs** property. |
