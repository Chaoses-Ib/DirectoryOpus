# OnFilesystemChange

The **OnFilesystemChange** event can be implemented by a [script add-in](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/README.md)Â to receive notification when monitored files or folders change. Monitoring is established by calling the **[FSUtil](../scripting_objects/fsutil.md).WatchChanges** method.
