# OnActivateLister

The **OnActivateLister** event can be implemented by a [script add-in](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/README.md)Â to receive notification whenever a Lister window becomes the active window, or loses activation to another window.

| **Method Name:** | OnActivateLister |
| --- | --- |
| **Argument Type:** | **[ActivateListerData](../scripting_objects/activatelisterdata.md)** |
| **Return Type:** | *none* |
| **Description:** | The **ActivateListerData.lister** property identifies the Lister, and the **active** property indicates whether this Lister has become active or inactive. If the activation moves from one Lister to another this event would be called twice, once for each Lister. |
