# OnOpenLister

The **OnOpenLister** event can be implemented by a [script add-in](/Manual/scripting/script_add-ins/README.md)Â to receive notification when a new Lister is opened.

| **Method Name:** | OnOpenLister |
| --- | --- |
| **Argument Type:** | **[OpenListerData](../scripting_objects/openlisterdata.md)** |
| **Return Type:** | *bool* |
| **Description:** | The **OpenListerData.lister** property identifies the newly opened Lister.<br /><br />This event is initially called immediately after the Lister has been created, before any folders have been read or any tabs have been opened. If you return **True** from this event, it will be called again after all tabs have been created. You can use the OpenListerData.after property to distinguish between these calls. |
