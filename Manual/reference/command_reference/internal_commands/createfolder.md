# CreateFolder

The **CreateFolder** internal command is used to:

- [Create new folders](/Manual/file_operations/creating_folders.md) (either via a dialog, an inline rename field in the file display, or with a pre-determined name)
- [Create new archive files](/Manual/file_operations/creating_archives/README.md)
- Create new [libraries](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/libraries.md), [collections](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/file_collections/README.md) and [stored query collections](/Manual/basic_concepts/virtual_file_system/file_collections/stored_queries.md)

**Command Arguments:** 

| Argument | Type | Possible values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARCHIVE | /O | *(no value)* | Create a new archive file. The archive format will default to .zip but can be changed via the dialog.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder ARCHIVE` |
|  |  | *\<archive format\>* | Create a new archive file of the specified format.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder ARCHIVE=.7z` |
| ARCHIVEARGS | /K | *\<archive arguments\>* | Used to pass format-specific arguments when creating an archive. The format these arguments take is defined by the plugin and archive type in question - currently, none of the standard archive formats Opus supports make use of this.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder ARCHIVE=.moo ARCHIVEARGS="/compression=1"` |
| ASK | /S | *(no value)* | If you specify a name with the **NAME** argument the *Create Folder* dialog does not normally display; instead the folder is created immediately. You can add the **ASK** argument to force the dialog to display, pre-populated with the specified name.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "My New Folder" ASK`<br /><br />If the specified name already exists before the prompt is displayed, it will have a number appended to it automatically so that is unique, similar to the way **CreateFolder** without any arguments will prompt to create *New Folder* and then *New Folder (2)*, *New Folder (3)*, and so on. |
| COLLQUERY | /S | *(no value)* | Creates a stored query collection rather than a regular file collection. This only has effect when actually creating a collection (because, for example, you are in the File Collections root folder at the time).<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder COLLQUERY` |
| FROMCLIPBOARD | /O | *(no value)* | Uses the text currently on the clipboard for the name of the new folder. Equivalent to \<nobr\>`CreateFolder "{clip}"`\</nobr\>.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder FROMCLIPBOARD` |
|  |  | **multi** | Creates multiple folders from the clipboard contents, assuming the clipboard contains multiple lines of CR/LF separated text. Without this keyword only the first line would be used.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder FROMCLIPBOARD=multi` |
| INLINE | /S | *(no value)* | Creates a new folder and lets you edit its name inline (in the file display) - equivalent to selecting *New -\> Folder* from the context or File menu.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder INLINE` |
| NAME | /M | *\<folder name\> ...* | Specify the name of the folder or archive to create. If this argument is supplied Opus will not prompt for a name (unless **ASK** is also specified). You can specify a full path, or just the folder name to create the folder in the current source directory. You can also specify multiple names to create more than one folder at once.<br /><br />This is the default argument for the **CreateFolder** command, so the keyword **NAME** does not need to be specified. However, if you need to create a folder whose name is one of the other argument names, you must use the more explicit **NAME="xyz"** form to avoid the *xyz* part being interpreted as an argument name instead of a folder name. If you need this while creating multiple folders, you can specify the **NAME** argument multiple times.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "Folder 1" "Folder 2" "Folder 3"`  <br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "C:\Program Files\My New Program"`  <br />*Example:* `CreateFolder NAME="Apple" NAME="Ask" NAME="Inline" ASK` |
| NOSEL | /S | *(no value)* | Normally when a folder is created in the currently displayed directory it is selected, and the display scrolled if necessary to make it visible. The **NOSEL** argument prevents this.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" NOSEL` |
| NOUPDATESETTINGS | /S | *(no value)* | Prevents settings made by this command from becoming the new defaults. For example, if you specify the **READAUTO** argument, the value you provide will become the new default setting for the CreateFolder command unless you also specify **NOUPDATESETTINGS**.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "{date\\|yyyyMMdd}" READAUTO NOUPDATESETTINGS` |
| MULTI | /O | *(no value)* | Ensures the *Create Folder* is in multiple-folder mode if it opens.<br /><br />If **MULTI** is not specified at all, the dialog remembers its previous mode (subject to **NOUPDATESETTINGS**) when no folder names are specified on the command line, uses single-folder mode when one name is specified, and uses multi-folder mode when multiple names are specified.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "Backup on {date\\|yyyy_MM_dd}" ASK MULTI` |
|  |  | **no** | Ensures the *Create Folder* dialog is in single-folder mode if it opens.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder MULTI=no` |
| READAUTO | /O | *(no value)* | Automatically read the newly created folder into the current source file display.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" READAUTO` |
|  |  | **no** | Do not automatically read the newly created folder.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" READAUTO=no` |
|  |  | **dual** | Read the newly created folder into the other file display. If the Lister is not currently in [dual-display](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/dual_display/README.md) mode it will be placed in this mode first. You can combine this value with **tab** to open a new tab in the other file display.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" READAUTO=dual` |
|  |  | **left** | Read the newly created folder into the left (or top) file display, regardless of which side is active. You can combine this value with **tab** to open a new tab.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "Stuff" READAUTO=left,tab` |
|  |  | **right** | Read the newly created folder into the right (or bottom) file display, regardless of which side is active. If the Lister is not currently in [dual-display](/Manual/basic_concepts/the_lister/dual_display/README.md) mode it will be placed in this mode first. You can combine this value with **tab** to open a new tab in the other file display.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "My Dir" READAUTO=right` |
|  |  | **tab** | Create a new tab for the newly created folder. The tab will be opened in the source file display unless **dual**, **left**, or **right** is also specified.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" READAUTO=dual,tab` |
|  |  | **nofocus** | When opening a new tab, prevents that tab from being made the active one.<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder "New Folder" READAUTO=tab,nofocus` |
| ZIP | /S | *(no value)* | Create a new Zip file (equivalent to `CreateFolder ARCHIVE=.zip`).<br /><br />*Example:* `CreateFolder ZIP` |
