# Command Reference

[Toolbar](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/toolbars.md) buttons, [menu](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/context_menus.md) items and [hotkeys](/Manual/customize/the_customize_dialog/keys.md) are constructed from one or more commands. There are two main types of commands, or instructions: internal and external.

- [Internal commands](/Manual/reference/command_reference/internal_commands/RAEDME.md) are the set of functions built-in to Opus - its "native language" if you like. There are around 30 commands that make up the internal command set, and each command takes one or more [arguments](/Manual/customize/creating_your_own_buttons/internal_command_arguments.md) that defines or modifies its behavior.
- External commands are other programs outside of Opus. Using one or more special [control codes](/Manual/reference/command_reference/external_control_codes/RAEDME.md), a toolbar button or hotkey can launch an external program and pass information like the names of selected files to it.

The third type of instruction that can be used in a button or hotkey is the [command modifier](/Manual/customize/creating_your_own_buttons/command_modifiers.md). These are not commands themselves - instead, they modify the behaviour of the overall button.
