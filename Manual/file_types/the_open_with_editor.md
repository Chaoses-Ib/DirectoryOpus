# The Open With editor

The Open With editor for a file type lets you edit the programs that are displayed on its *Open With* list - the sub-menu of the same name that appears on a file's context menu. This setting applies to both Opus and Explorer.

To access the Open With editor, select the file type in the [File Types](/Manual/file_types/RAEDME.md) dialog and then click the **Change** button at the bottom.

The Open With editor contains two lists of programs. The list on the right defines the programs that are currently shown in the file's *Open With* menu. The list on the left is a list of all "available programs". These are programs that are "known" to Windows - they have been used to open files in the past. If the program you're looking for isn't on that list, click the **Browse** button to locate it by hand.

To add a program to the *Open With* list, simply select it in the right-hand list and click the **Add** button to move it to the left. Similarly, to remove a program from the *Open With* list, select it in the list on the left and click **Remove** to move it back to the list on the right.

You can also choose the default program to open files of this type with by selecting the item in the *Open With* list and clicking the **Set Default** button.
